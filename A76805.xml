            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth;</hi> this ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> on the entrance upon <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Whereupon the Jew <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and ſome Ethniques willing to ſhew that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had read <hi>Moſes</hi> bookes, and from thence drawne the greateſt part of their moſt ſecret Philoſophy, alledged that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have ſaid, that the heaven and the earth were firſt created; <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> after, <hi>Timaeus Locrien</hi> ſaid that God firſt aſſembled Fire and Earth, to build an univerſe thereof; (we will ſhew it more ſenſibly of <hi>Zohar</hi> in the Weik of a Candle lighted, for all conſiſts of light, being the firſt of all Creatures.) Theſe Philoſophers preſuppoſing that the World conſiſted (as indeed it doth) of the foure Elements, which are as well in heaven, and yet higher, as in the earth, and lower, but in a diverſe manner.</p>
               <p>The two higheſt, Aire and Fire, being compriſed under the name of Heaven and of the Aethereall Region: for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> comes from the verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſhine, and to enflame, the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of theſe Elements. And under the word Earth, the two lower, Earth and Water, incorporated into one Globe. But although <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet Heaven before Earth; (and obſerve here that in all <hi>Geneſis</hi> he toucheth at nothing but things ſenſible, but not of intelligible things; which is a point apart) for concerning this, there is no good agreement between Jewes and Chriſtians; Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his first <hi>Homily.</hi> Obſerve a little with what dignity the Divine Nature comes to ſhine in his manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the creation of things; For God contrary to Artiſts in building his Edifice, ſtretched out firſt the heavens round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, afterwards planted the earth below.</p>
               <p>Hee wrought firſt at the head, and afterwards came to the foundation. But it is the Hebrewes cuſtome, that when they ſpeake moſt of a thing, they ordinarily put the laſt in order, which they pretend to touch firſt: And the ſame is here practiſed, where Heaven is alledged before Earth, which he comes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry immediately after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth, and the Earth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153427:4"/> was without Forme and void;</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth the ſame, upon the entrance to his Goſpell, <hi>The Booke of the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of David, the ſon of Abraham, Abraham begat Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> For it is well knowne, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a long time before <hi>David:</hi> Otherwiſe it ſeemes, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would particularly demonſtrate, that the Earth was made before the Heaven, by the Creation of man, that is, the Image and pourtrait of the great World, for that in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis, God formed man of the ſlime of the earth,</hi> (that is to ſay,) his body which it repreſents; <hi>and afterwards breathed in his face the ſpirit, or breath of life:</hi> that carrieth him backe to heaven; whereunto ſuits that which is written in the 1 to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>The firſt man from the earth is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the ſecond man from heaven is heavenly: the firſt man Adam was made a living ſoule; and the laſt Adam, a quickning ſpirit.</hi> Whereto the Generation of the Creature relates, who ſix weeks after the Conception, is nothing but a maſſe of informed fleſh, till the ſoule that is infuſed from above, doth vivifie it.</p>
               <p>Moreover the foure Elements (whereof all is made) conſiſts of foure qualities, Hot and Drie, Cold and Moiſt; two of them are bound up in each of them: <hi>Earth,</hi> that is to ſay, Cold and Dry, the <hi>Water,</hi> Cold and Moiſt; the <hi>Aire,</hi> Moiſt and Hot; the <hi>Fire,</hi> Hot and Dry: whence it comes to joine with the earth; for the Elements are circular, as <hi>Hermes</hi> would have it; each being engirded with two others, with whom it agreeth in one of their qualities; which is thereunto appropriate: as Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Fire and Water, participates with the Fire in dryneſſe, and with Water in coldneſſe; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Man then which is the Image of the great World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from is called the Microcoſme, or little World, as the World which is made after the reſemblance of his Archetype, is called the great man; being compoſed of foure Elements, ſhall have alſo its heaven and its earth: The ſoule, and underſtanding, are its heaven, the body and ſenſuality, its earth: So that to know the heaven and earth of man, is to have true and entire knowledge of all the Univerſe, and of the Nature of things.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge of the ſenſible World, we come to that of the Creator, and the Intelligible world; by the Creature, the Creator is underſtood, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Fire then gives
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153427:5"/> motion to the body, Aire feeling, Water nouriſhment, and Earth ſubſiſtence. Moreover heaven deſignes the intelligible world, the earth the ſenſible: Each of them is ſubdivided into two, (in every caſe I ſpeake not but after <hi>Zohar</hi> and the ancient <hi>Rabbins.</hi>) The intelligible into Paradiſe and Hell; and the ſenſible, to the Celeſtiall and Elementary world: Upon this paſſage <hi>Origen</hi> makes a faire diſcourſe at the entry on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that God firſt made the heaven or the intelligible world, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is ſpoken in the 66. of <hi>Eſay, Heaven is my ſeat and Earth my footſtoole;</hi> Or rather it is God in whom the world dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and not the world which is Gods habitation: For in him <hi>we live,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> 
                  <hi>move, and have our being;</hi> for the true ſeat and habitation of God, is his proper eſſence: and before the Creation of the World, as <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> ſets downe, in his Chapte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, there was nothing but the eſſence of God, and his name, which are but one thing: Then after the heaven, or the intelligible world, <hi>Origen</hi> purſues, <hi>God made the Firmament,</hi> that is to ſay, this ſenſible world; for every body hath I know not what firmneſſe and ſolidity, and all ſolidity is corporal; and as that which God propoſed to make, conſiſteth of Body and of Spirit, for this cauſe it is written, that God firſt made the Heaven, that is to ſay, all ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, upon which, as upon a certaine throne, hee repoſeth himſelfe. The Firmament for our regard is the body, which <hi>Zohar</hi> calleth the Temple, and the Apoſtle alſo, <hi>Yee are Gods Temple,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.17. And the Heaven, which is ſpirituall, is our ſoule, and the inner man; the Firmament is the externall, that neither ſeeth, nor knoweth God but ſenſibly. So that man is double, an animall, and ſpirituall body, the one Internall, Spirituall, Inviſible; that which Saint <hi>Marke</hi> in this place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth for man; the other Externall, Corporall, Animal, which he denotes by the Sacrifice which comprehendeth not the things that are of the Spirit of God, but the Spirituall diſcerneth all; So that the exteriour man is an animal compared to brute beaſts, whereout they tooke their offerings for Sacrifices: He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fooliſh Beaſts, and is made like them; for a man hath no more then a Beaſt: we muſt underſtand the Carnall, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall, that conſiſts of this viſible body, that dyeth as well as Beaſts, are corrupt and returne to Earth: Whence <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid very well, that which is ſeene of man, is not man properly. And in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153427:5"/> the firſt of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> yet more diſtinctly, that Man is I know not what elſe, then his body, namely his ſoule, as it followes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. That which <hi>Cicero</hi> borrowed out of <hi>Scipio's</hi> dreame; But underſtand it thus, that thou art not mortall, but this body; thou art not that, which this forme declares, but every mans minde is himſelfe, not that figure which may be demonſtrated by the finger: And the Philoſopher <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> while the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Nicocreon</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> cauſed him to be brayed in a great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Morter, cried out with a loud voice, <hi>Stampe hard, bruiſe the barke of Anaxarchus, for it is not him that thou ſtampeſt.</hi>

               <p>But will it be permitted for me here, to bring ſomething of <hi>Metubales?</hi> All that is, is either Inviſible, or Viſible; Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, or Senſible; Agent, and Patient; Forme, and Matter; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Body; the Interiour and the Exteriour man; Fire, and Water; that which ſeeth, and that which is ſeen.</p>
               <p>But that which ſeeth is much more excellent and more worthy then that which is ſeen, and there is nothing that ſeeth, but the inviſible, where that which is ſeene, is as a blind thing; therefore Water is a proper and ſerviceable ſubject, over whom the Fire or Spirit may out-ſtretch his action.</p>
               <p>Alſo he hath elevated it for his habitation and reſidence; for by introducing it, he elevates it on high in the nature of Aire contiguous unto it: which inviſible Spirit (of the Lord was carryed on the waters, or rather did ſit over t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Body and Spirit, water and fire, are deſigned unto us by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt Creatures of all others engendred of the ſeed of man and woman, and by their Sacrifices, whence thoſe of <hi>Cain</hi> iſſuing from the fruits of the earth, were by conſequent corporall, dead, and inanimate, and together deſtitute of faith, which dependeth of the Spirit, and are by Fire diſſolved into a wateriſh vapour,<note place="margin">Pour le nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veau.</note> ſo that to go to finde it in its ſphere and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the newes, we are to ſuffer thereunder. But thoſe of <hi>Abel</hi> were ſpirituall, animate, full of life, that reſides in the bloud; full of piety and devotion. This alſo <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and the author
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153427:6"/> of the <hi>Handfull of Myrrh,</hi> call a fire deſcending from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to regather them: which happened not to thoſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> which a ſtrange fire devoured; and from thence was declared the exteriour man, ſenſuall, animall, that muſt bee ſalted with Salt; But <hi>Abel</hi> the interiour, ſpirituall, ſalted with Fire; which is double, the materiall and eſſentiall, the actuall and potentiall, as it is in burnings. All what is ſenſible, and viſible, is purged by the actuall, and the inviſible, and intelligible, by the ſpiritual and potentiall. Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> on the Treatiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and of the Soule. What is man, the ſoule of him, or the fleſh, or the aſſembly of thoſe two? for the clothing is one thing, and the thing clothed another. Indeed there are two men (I leave the <hi>Meſſibe</hi> apart) <hi>Adam</hi> was made and formed of God; in reſpect of the body, of aſhes, and of earth, but afterwards inſpired in him the Spirit of Life; if he had kept himſelfe from miſpriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was like unto Angels, made participant of eternall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but his tranſgreſſion diſpoſſeſſed him. The other man is he, which comes ſucceſſively to be borne of man and woman, who by his originall offence is made ſubject to death, to paines, travails, and diſeaſes, therefore muſt hee returne from whence he came. But touching the ſoule that came from God, it remains in its free will: if it will adhere to God, it is capable to bee admitted into the ranke of his children, <hi>who are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Such was <hi>Adam</hi> before his firſt tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſoule then, which is the inner man, ſpirit, and the very true man which liveth properly, for the body hath no life of it ſelfe, nor motion; and is nothing elſe but as it were the barke and clothing of the inner man, according to <hi>Zohar,</hi> alledging that out of the 10 of <hi>Job</hi> 11. <hi>Thou haſt clothed me with skinne and fleſh;</hi> whereunto that in the 6. of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſeemeth to agree, where to ſhew us how much the ſoule ought to bee in greater recommendation then the body, as more worthy and pretious; our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Take no care then how to cloth your body, is not your body better then raiment?</hi> and by conſequent, the ſoule more then the body, ſince the body is but as it were the veſtment of the ſoule, which is ſubject to periſh, and to uſe, <hi>(all ſhall wax old as doth a garment.)</hi> And the Apoſtle in the 1 to the <hi>Corinthians, The old man falleth away, but the inner man is renewed dayly;</hi> for it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153427:6"/> waſheth it ſelfe (according to <hi>Zohar</hi>) by the fire, as doth a <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> and the outward man by water, with Soaps and Lees that conſiſt of Salts. Of which two manners of repurging, it is thus ſaid in the 31. of <hi>Numb. v.</hi> 23. <hi>All that which ſhall ſupport the fire, ſhall be purged thereby, and that which cannot beare it, ſhall be ſanctified by the water of Purification;</hi> which was a figure of that which the Fore-runner ſpake in the 3. of <hi>Matthew, It is true that I baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that comes after mee, ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But behold how <hi>Zohar</hi> ſpeakes more particularly. If it bee ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> what is he? it is nought but skin, and fleſh, and bones, and nerves, he muſt not paſſe ſo. But to ſpeak truth, man is nothing elſe, but the immortall ſoule that is in him; and the skinne, fleſh, bloud, bones, and nerves, are the veſtments wherein it is wrapped, as a little creature newly borne within the beds and linnen of its Cradle: Theſe are but the utenſils, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allotted to womens children, not to man or <hi>Adam;</hi> for when this <hi>Adam</hi> ſo made, was elevated out of this world, he is deveſted of thoſe inſtruments, wherewith he had beene clothed and accommodated. This is the skinne wherewith the Son of man is envelopped with fleſh, bones, and nerves; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſecret myſtery of Sapience, according to that which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught in the Curtains or Vails of the Tabernacle, which are the inward veſtment, and the Tabernacle the outward: To this purpoſe, the Apoſtle in the fifth of the 2 to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have an Aedifice not built with mans hand, but eternally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in the high Heavens. For in this we groane, earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to bee clothed upon, with our houſe which is from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if ſo be, that being clothed wee ſhall not bee found naked.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of his body, is a repreſentation of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world; where his skinne correſponds with the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, extending heaven like a Curtaine. For as the heaven covereth and enveloppeth all things, ſo doth the skin every man; in which, are introduced and faſtned its ſtarres and ſignes, that is to ſay, the draughts and lineaments in the hands, the forehead, and viſage, in which wiſe men know and reveale, and makes them diſcerne the inclination of its naturall, imprinted in the inward; And he that doth conjecture from thence, is as he, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153427:7"/> whom heaven being covered with Clouds, cannot perceive the conſtellations that are there, or otherwiſe darkened from his ſight. And although the ſageſt and moſt expert in theſe things can finde out ſomething therein denoted by the draughts and lineaments of the palme of the hand, and fingers, or within them; for by the outſide, (it is caſe a part) and ſhew nothing, but the nailes which are not a little ſecret and myſtery, becauſe by death they are obfuſcate, but have a ſhining luſtre while they live, in the haire, eyes, noſe, and lips, and all the reſt of his perſon. For as God hath made the Sunne, Moone, and Stars, thereby to declare to the great World, not only the day, night, and ſeaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the change of times, and many ſignes that muſt appeare in the earth. So hath he manifeſted in the little world Man, certaine draughts and lineaments, holding place of lights and ſtarres, whereby men may attaine to the knowledge of very great ſecrets, not common, nor knowne of all. Hence is it that the Intelligences of the ſuperiour world do diſtill and breath as it were, by ſome channels their influences, whereby the effects come to ſtruggle and accompliſh their effects here below, as of things drawn with a rude and ſtrong bow, will plant themſelves within a Butt, where they reſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>But to retake the diſcourſe of this double man, and the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſaith, <hi>That there are bodies Celeſtial, and bodies Terreſtrial, yet there is a glory both of the one, and of the other. There is a naturall, or animall body, and there is a body ſpirituall: he will raiſe up the ſpirituall body incorruptible;</hi> To this relates the Fire, to the corruptible Salt.</p>
               <p>From theſe veſtments furthermore the occaſion preſents it ſelfe to a larger extenſion, the better to declare who muſt be ſeaſoned with Fire, and who with Salt; which is here expreſſed by the offering, to whom the exteriour doth correſpond, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>I pray you brethren, by the mercy of God, that you offer up your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto him, which is your reaſonable ſervice:</hi> which it could not make it ſelfe the habitation of the Holy Ghoſt, if it were not pure, neat, and incontaminate. <hi>Know you not that your Body is the Temple of the holy Spirit which is in you?</hi> which in Scripture is commonly deſigned by fire, with which wee muſt be ſalted inwardly, that is to ſay, preſerved from corruption; and from what corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153427:7"/> from ſinne that putrifies our ſoules. <hi>Origen</hi> in his 7. book againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> ſpeaking of its veſtments, ſets downe, that being of it ſelfe incorporeall and inviſible, in what corporall place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it findes it ſelfe, it muſt have a body convenable to the nature of the place where it reſides. As then when it is in this Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary world, it muſt have alſo an elementary body, which it takes when it is incorporated in the belly of a woman, to grow there, and there to live this baſe life with the body, that it hath taken to the limited terme; which expired, it deveſts it ſelfe of this corruptible veſtment, although neceſſary in the earth from whence it came (following that which God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> in the third of <hi>Geneſis, Thou art duſt, and ſhalt returne to duſt,</hi>) to be reveſted with an incorruptible, whoſe perpetuall abode is in Heaven. <hi>For this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortality.</hi> And ſo the ſoul putting off its firſt Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall veſtment, takes another more excellent above in the Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Region, which is of the nature of Fire: hitherto <hi>Origen,</hi> to which nothing could be found more conformable, then that which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> puts towards the end of his golden verſes: Thus forſaking this mortall body, thou paſſeſt into the free Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall Aire, you ſhall become an immortall God, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no more ſubject to death: as if he would ſay, that after this materiall corruptible body, ſhall put off the Terreſtriall and impure veſtment, the perfect portion of it ſhall ſhake off theſe filthineſſes and impurities, and ſhall paſſe aloft to heaven and adhere to God, which it could not doe, but being pure and neat; nor effect this, but by fire. <hi>Zohar</hi> ſpeakes to the ſame purpoſe, when the Elements deſtroy themſelves, an aethereall body ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in their place which doth recloath them; or to ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the aethereall body which was reclad with them, deveſts it ſelfe; and this is repreſented to us in the 5 of <hi>Eſther,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>on the third day</hi> ſhee tooke off her clothes that ſhee was wont to weare, <hi>and put on her royall apparell to appeare before the King;</hi> which ſignifies the holy Spirit, and <hi>Eſther</hi> the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, whoſe veſtments are the garments of the kingdome of Heaven; of which he that <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. chap. was ſaid to be like to the Son of God, that crowns the juſt, and adornes them with royall apparell, to bring them into the preſence of the King of Kings, to the Paradiſe of pleaſure, clenſed with aire from above,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153427:8"/> which the holy Spirit breathed into it. <hi>Origen</hi> in his ſecond Homily upon the 36 <hi>Pſalme.</hi> It is the manner of holy Scripture to introduce two ſorts of men, that is to ſay, the interiour and the exteriour, each of which, hath need as much as concernes him, of apparell, as well as nouriſhment; the external corporal man, maintaines himſelfe with meats corruptible, proper and familiar to himſelfe, having ever need of Salt, beſides their own connaturall; but there is alſo meat for the inward, whereof it is ſaid in the 8 of <hi>Deuteronomy, Man doth not live by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> And for matter of drinke, the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Our fathers did eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and did drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke; for they did drinke of that ſpirituall rocke that followed them, and that rocke was Chriſt.</hi> Who ſpeaking of this drinke in the 4. of Saint <hi>John,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that hee is the fountaine of living water, and who ſo drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the water that he ſhall give them, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> There are alſo two rayments in regard of the inner man. If he be a ſinner, it is ſaid <hi>Pſalme</hi> 109. <hi>He hath put on malediction as a garment,</hi> which muſt <hi>be to him as his apparell, wherewith he is covered, and as a girdle wherewith he is girt.</hi> And on the contrary the Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Lie not one to another, having caſt off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new, but be clothed with mercy, benignity, humility, and meekneſſe of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the veſtments which <hi>Zohar</hi> ſaid were the good works and the nuptiall accouſtrements of the ſoule, which cannot bee waſhed or cleanſed but by Fire, <hi>Every mans worke ſhall bee made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire, and the fire ſhall try every mans worke of what ſort it is,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. wherein they ſhall perſiſt without impaire, or conſumption, but ſhall be purified when the ſoule ſhall therewith be clothed; from this uncleane ſcumme, wherein there may remaine ſome ſpots that the fire goes on to purge, conſuming and defacing them. But what it this fire? It is it which is ſaid in the 4 and 9 of <hi>Deuteronomy, our God is a conſuming fire:</hi> which as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets, was to ſtrike feare and terror into the Iſraelites; and this afterwards in the 12 to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 28, 29. <hi>Let us ſerve God acceptably with feare and reverence, for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> For they had ſufficiently underſtood that the world once peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the univerſall deluge, and that it may not incurre the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153427:8"/> like accident, but ſuffer its laſt extermination by fire. Adde that in the 33. of the Moſaicall Law, it is called <hi>The Law of fire,</hi> which is in the right hand of the Almighty, becauſe of its auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and rigour, all filled with menaces, with feares, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; as much as the Chriſtian is, with ſweetneſſe and mercy: in his right hand, there is a fiery Law: which the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe interpreteth, for that it was given on <hi>Mount Horeb,</hi> through the middeſt of fire, according as it is ſaid in the 4. to the purpoſe touching this feare. <hi>The Lord ſpeake unto me ſaying, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people there below, that they may heare my words, and learne to feare me: Then came you neare to the foote that burned even to heaven, and the Lord ſpake unto you out of the midſt of fire.</hi> And <hi>Exodus</hi> 3. <hi>the burning buſh wherein God appeared unto Moſes, and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</hi> Of this conſuming fire, further ſpeaketh <hi>Zohar</hi> thus in conformity to that received <hi>Maxime</hi> in naturall Philoſophy, that a great flame doth devoure and quench a leſſe: as wee may ſenſibly perceive by a lighted Torch, which is extinguiſhed by the Sunbeams, and by a kettle ſet neare a great fire that ſucks and drawes all out to it ſelfe: Hee ſaith then upon this Text of the 35. of <hi>Exod. You ſhall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath:</hi> To which purpoſe, ſaid <hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi> was that ordained? and why was it not lawfull to kindle a fire on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day? becauſe that when men kindle fire, it goeth ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards according to its naturall, and moving above every thing, following that of the 7. of Sapience, where it is compared to fire. In Wiſdome is the ſpirit of underſtanding, holy, one only, manifold, ſubtill, lively, cleare, undefiled, plaine, moveable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every thing, and overtops all by reaſon of its purity. The Fire hath two properties, to be moving, and pure, not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of any uncleanneſſe; and all motion, is a kinde of action and operation, forbidden expreſly on the Sabbath day. Fire then mounting aloft, caries with it the impurities deſigned in the 10. of <hi>Leviticus</hi> by ſtrange fire, which is there devoured by that which proceeds from the preſence of the Lord. And ſhould bee as much, as thereby to draw from it ſelfe a judgement of his offences that muſt not be renewed in the ſanctification of the Sabbath, for feare that the fire of Gods wrath do not devour and conſume that of our iniquities, and us at once, if this our fire be not firſt purged by a ſtronger fire, that conſumeth and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153427:9"/> the leſſer and more feeble: <hi>Zohar</hi> runs through all that, and upon the paſſage of the foreſaid fourth of <hi>Deut. Thy God is a conſuming fire;</hi> he ſpeakes further,</p>
               <p>There is a double fire, the one ſtronger, that devoures the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that will know it, let him contemplate the flame that parteth and mounteth from a kindled Fire, or from a Lampe or Torch; for it mounteth not, except it be incorporated to ſome viſible ſubſtance, and united with the aire, whereupon it feedeth. But in the flame that mounteth there are two lights, the one white, which ſhineth and illightneth, having its root ſomewhat blew; the other red, faſtned to the wood, or to the weik that it burneth. That which is white, mounteth directly upwards, and underneath the red remaineth firme, and departs not from the matter, adminiſtring wherewith to flame and ſhine to the other; but they come upon the point to joine and unite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one burning, the other burned, till they bee converted into that which predominates and playes the maſter, namely the white, alwayes the ſame without variation and change, as the other doth; which now growes blacke, after becomes red, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, peach colour, sky colour, azure reinforced above and below, above with a white flame, below with the blackneſſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which furniſheth it where withall to burne, and at the laſt is therewith conſumed. For this azure, red, and yellow flame, the more groſſe and materiall it is, endeavours alwayes to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and deſtroy that which nouriſhed and maintained it: as ſinnes do the conſcience which harbours them, to the end to make them the perdition and ruine of all that which adheres to it here below, ſo long, till at the laſt it remaines extinct; there where the light annexed thereunto, is not eternally extinguiſhed but goes freely upward, and returnes to its proper place of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, or reſidence; having accompliſhed its action below, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing its brightneſſe into any other colour then white. In the like caſe is it of a tree, whoſe roots are faſtned within the earth, from whence it takes it nouriſhment, as the weik takes his from the tallow, waxe, or oyle, which makes it burne.</p>
               <p>The branch that drawes its juice or ſap, by the root, is the ſame as the weik, where the fire is maintained by the liquor which it drawes unto it, and the white flame, are the branches
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153427:9"/> and boughes, clad with leaves, the flowers and fruits, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tends the finall end of a tree, are the white flame when all comes to bee reduced: wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid that <hi>thy God is a conſuming fire,</hi> as it is true; for the fire conſumes and devoures all that which is under it, and upon which it exerciſeth its action. And therefore very proper in the Hebrew text <hi>Elohenu,</hi> thy God, and not <hi>Anonenu,</hi> thy Lord, becauſe the Prophet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Strange fire, is all the ardor of ſlippery concupiſcence, of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, hatred, rancour, and envy; And of this fire no man is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nor expiated, but well burned, which if men offer in the preſence of the Lord, celeſtiall fire will devour, as it did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abibu;</hi> and therefore, he that will purge his ſinne, he muſt caſt off from him this ſtrange fire, and let him expiate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; whereof it is ſaid in the 6 of <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. <hi>One of the Seraphims flew to me hauing a live coale in his hand, which he had taken with the Tongs from off the Altar, and touched my lips, ſaying, Lo this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is saken away, and thy ſinne purged.</hi> Having ſaid a little before, that all the houſe was filled with ſmoake, which is as an excrement and vapour of fire, bee it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be lighted, or inflamed, or after it be mortified, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; from whence it comes to procreate ſoot, then which, there is nothing more troubleſome and hurtfull to the eies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carryed away with it a parcell of a duſtible corruption; which adminiſtred to the fire its nouriſhment and food This may bee ſeen in the diſtillation of ſoote, where there appeares a notable quantity of inflamable oyle, which cauſeth it yet to burne; and of this burning there will ariſe a ſmoake, which will againe be concreted into a burning ſmoake, as a foreſaid, but not ſo much.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the remnants of ſinne, whereof remained ſome ſtaines printed in the ſoule, untill at the laſt, by a ſucceſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of fire, it be reduced to a point of compleat purity; whereof it is ſpoken in the 4. of the <hi>Canticles, Thou art faire my welbeloved, there is no blemiſh in thee;</hi> which the white flame noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, which is the higheſt degree of burning. Thoſe alſo well know it that maintaine a fire, for when a Fornace begins to bee hot, it waxeth blacke, then enforcing the fire, it becomes red, and at laſt it waxeth white when it is in the ſupreame and high degree of heat, where it perſiſteth in whiteneſſe more and more. Such are the actions of fire, but there are great myſteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under, ever to declare further the advantage and praecellency, that the white colour hath above the red, as to the Chriſtian faith, deſigned by white water, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.2. <hi>(In the middle of the Throne there was a Sea of Glaſſe, like unto Cryſtall,)</hi> far

               <p>But ſome may ſay here are many things, which by little and little do turne us from our principall aime, and are as it were extravagant dreſſes. But not altogether, yet as to mount ſome ſharpe precipice, wee muſt turne about to goe at more eaſe, to ſhunne cliffes and precipices: So are wee ſometimes to make ſome ſmall by-courſes and digreſſions to facilitate our Theame. Rivers that goe turning are more commodious for Navigation, then thoſe that runne impetuouſly one way downe.</p>
               <p>There ſhall bee nothing at laſt (God willing) unprofitable, nor from the purpoſe. Then all this red and white, is but Fire and Water, the pillar of fire by night, and the white cloud by day; into which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the people of the Jewes were baptized;</hi> and in this cloud the divine Wiſdome eſtabliſhed his Throne; that of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> this of grace; Fire and Salt. <hi>Zohar</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Moſes</hi> his two firſt Tables, broken for the Idolatry of the Golden Calfe, with two pillars, the one of fire, repreſenting naturall heate, by which all things are vivified; the other is water, that is radical moiſture, which maintaineth life, (from which, that is not much different in the 15. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>he ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſs mingled with fire,</hi>)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153427:11"/> which radicall moiſture was perverted and changed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge by the univerſall inundation, ſo that it was not ſince ſo vigorous as before: but ſhall at laſt bee brought to exterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on all ſides, at the end of time by a finall conflagration. The firſt mutation ſhall meet with ſome mercy, the race of mankinde being at that time not wholly extinct, but the remainder was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>Noah,</hi> and his in the Arke: but the ſecond ſhall have none, but all ſhall periſh by the extreame rigour of fire: To the purpoſe of theſe two ſubſtances, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Eaſt adored Fire, as that which repreſented to them naturall heat, and the Aegyptians with all thoſe on the South of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which is radicall moiſture which goes to render it ſelfe into a Sea impregned with ſalt, to preſerve it in the end from corruption: Now for this effect, all humours of animall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, bloud, ſpittle, urine, and the reſt, are ſalted, without which, all would corrupt each other, in an inſtant: Behold the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that there is in holy writ, that apply the meditations of things ſenſible to Sacramentall myſteries; and of ratiocinations of blinde Paganiſme, who not turning it but above the barke, penetrate no further, then that which the uncertain and doubtful ſenſe may make them comprehend, without paſſing further to the relation of divine things; where at laſt al muſt refer to ſpiritualty: reſembling therein properly to the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> who beates ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the wing as if ſhee would mount to heaven, but yet her feet for all that, do not forſake the earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phaenician</hi> Theologie, admitted but of one Element, Fire; which is the principall and chief of all, the productor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of all things: which doth not much diſagree from that in the 118. <hi>Pſal.</hi> is the fiery word by which times were formed. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> alſo puts fire, for the firſt ſubſtance that informed all, and from whence they drew all things from power into action, as well ſuperiour, as inferiour, celeſtiall and terreſtriall: For hot and cold, moiſt and dry, are not ſubſtances, but qualities and accidents; from whence naturall Philoſophers forged four Elements, whereas according to verity there is but one; which according to the veſtments that it receives from the accidentall qualitie, takes divers appellations. If from the heat, it is from the Aire; from moiſture, Water; from dryneſſe, Earth; which three are but one fire, but reclothed with divers and different
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153427:11"/> habits. Even as Fire extending it ſelfe in all, and through all; ſo all things come to render unto it, as to the center. So that it may be rightly called an infinite and indetermined vigour of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather the vivification thereof, for without it nothing could be comprehended, ſeen, or obtained, above or below; that which illightens is celeſtiall, that which concocts and digeſts Aereall, and that which burnes, is terreſtriall; which cannot ſubſiſt without ſome groſſe matter coming from the Earth, which he reduceth in the end to it ſelfe; as we may ſee in things burned, converted to aſhes, from whence after the extraction of Salt, reſts nothing but pure earth. Salt being a potentiall fire, and wateriſh, that is to ſay, terreſtriall water, impregned with fire; from whence all ſorts of mineralls, come to production, for they are of the nature of Water. The experiment may bee ſeene in ſtrong Waters, all compoſed of minerall Salts, Alums, Saltpeters, which burne as Fire: which produceth hot and dry exhalations agitated with winds, eaſie to take flame, alſo of flints, of Iron, and of Wood, and of ſcraped bones, eſpecially thoſe of a Lion, as ſaith <hi>Pliny:</hi> whence we may gather that there is potentiall fire in all.</p>
               <p>Not without cauſe then did <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> ordaine not to ſpeake of God, or divine things, without fire: for of all things ſenſible, there is nothing that ſymbolizeth, or more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with Divinity then Fire: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writing to <hi>Alexander</hi> related unto him, that hee had learned of the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> that there was a fift Element or Eſſence, which is fire, wherein the Divinity reſides: becauſe it is the nobleſt, and pureſt of all the Elements; and that which purgeth all things according to <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſtes: Plutarch</hi> alledgeth that this Divinity is a ſpirit of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intellectuall fire, that hath no forme, but transformes to it ſelfe all that it toucheth, and tranſmutes it ſelfe into all, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi> the <hi>Genius</hi> of Aegypt was wont to ſay,
<q>Omnia tranſformat ſeſe in miraecula rerum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And according to <hi>Zoroaſtes</hi> all things were engendred of this fire. It is the light which dwelleth (this ſaith <hi>Porphyrius</hi>) in an Aethereal fire, for the elementary diſſipates all: But more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> in the 15. of the Celeſtiall Hierarchy.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153427:12"/> Divinity to our ſenſes, foraſmuch as they can conceive and apprehend of the nature and divine Eſſence. The very Scripture in many places, call God and Angels Fire, and doth not onely propoſe unto us Chariots and wheeles of Fire; but of igneall animals, of burning brookes and rivers, of coales and men all burned: All theſe celeſtial bodies are but flaming lights, and thrones, and Seraphims all of fire; there is ſo great affinity and agreement with Divinity: for the fire that the feeling and ſmelling perceiveth, is ſeparated in reſpect of the ſubſtance from all others, that may bee joined and mingled therewith, except it bee of the matter, to which it is incorporated to burne. It ſhines, it ſpreads it ſelfe from ſide to ſide, and gathering it ſelfe to its ſelfe, with its light it illuſtrates all that is neare it, nor can it bee ſeene without the matter whereto it adheres, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth its action no more then Divinity, but by its effects; nor arreſt, nor faſten, nor mingle with any thing, nor change ſo long as it liveth, there where it handleth all things, and draws them to its ſelfe, and to its nature. It renewes and rejoyceth all with vitall heat, it illuſtrates and illuminates all, tending alwaies upward, with agility and incomparable ſpeed. It communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his motion to all, its light, its heat, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its ſubſtance, what portion ſoever it lends, but ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines entire in it ſelfe. It comes ſuddenly and returneth as faſt, without mans knowledge whence it comes, or whither it goes: with many other worthy conſiderations of this common fire, which brings us to the knowledge of the divine fire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this materiall, is but as a garment and coverture; and Salt the coverture of Fire, which is appeaſed in Salt, and agreeth with its enemy, Water; as Earth in Saltpeter doth with its contra-oppoſite the Aire; by reaſon of the water that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, for Saltpeter participates of the nature of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and of Fire, for that it burnes; and of Salt, for that it reſolves into water. For ſaith <hi>Heber,</hi> it is the property of Salts, and Alums, to bee diſſolved into water, ſith they were made thereof. But of this more to the purpoſe hereafter in its place.</p>
               <p>The meditations of the Covertures, and reveſtments are of no ſmall importance, to mount from things ſenſible, to things intelligible, for they are all infolded one in another, as an <hi>Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clie</hi>

So that the Pythagoreans call the Moone the Celeſtial earth; and the heaven or terreſtrial Star, all the nature here below in the elementary world, being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the celeſtiall, and the celeſtiall of the intelligible; this <hi>Zohar</hi> called feminine &amp; paſſible, as from the Moone towards the Sunne, from whom ſo much as ſhe abſents her ſelfe till ſhe comes to its oppoſition, by ſo much ſhe increaſeth in light for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard here below; where on the contrarry in her conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſhee remaines all darkened, the party upward is all illightned, to ſhew us, that the more that our underſtanding doth abate to things ſenſible, ſo much the more doth he disjoine or ſever them from the intelligible; and contrariwiſe, this was the cauſe that <hi>Adam</hi> was lodged in an earthly Paradiſe, to have more leiſure to contemplate on divine things; when he thought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153427:13"/> to turne after ſenſible and temporall things, willing to taſte of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evill, whereby hee departed from that of life, to aſſubject himſelfe to death, he was baniſhed from thence and put out. To this very purpoſe <hi>Zohar</hi> doth yet adde, that two veſtments come from heaven to this temporall life; The one formall, white, and reſplendent; maſculine, fatherly, and agent; for whatſoever is active takes place from forme, of the male and from the father, and this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing comes to us from fire, and from the clearneſſe of the ſtars to illuſtrate our underſtanding. The other is red, mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, faeminine; for the ſoule, coming from the ſubſtance of heaven, which is more rare then that of heavenly bodies. That of the underſtanding is lodged in the braine, and the other of the ſoule, in the heart. The intellect or underſtanding, is that part of the reaſonable ſoule made and formed after the image and ſemblance of its Creators and the ſoule in it, the animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty called <hi>Nepheſch,</hi> the life, namely, that which reſideth in the bloud: and as the heaven containes the ſtars, this contains the intellect, which to us is for the reſt common with brute beaſts. But the intellect, or reaſonable ſoule is proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to men, that which can merit or demerit; therefore it needs repurgation and cleanſing from the ſpots that it hath drawne and conceived from the fleſh wherein it was plunged, according to that in the 8. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 21. <hi>The thought and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans heart, were inclined to evill from his youth.</hi> And fith it is a queſtion, about cleanſing the veſtment which is of a fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it muſt likewiſe be, that it be done b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You came to the foot of a mountaine that burned, even to heaven, and therein was darkneſs, thick clouds, and obſcurity:</hi> for in regard of God towards us, light and darkneſſe, are but one thing: as is his darkneſſe, ſuch is his light: And in the 16 of <hi>Iſaiah, Make thy ſhadow as the night, in the midſt of the noone day.</hi> The very ſame, as well the affirmative, as the negative; by which, that which is aequippollent unto darkneſſe, we may better apprehend ſomething of the Divine Eſſence, but not by the affirmative, that relates unto light, as <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> doth excellently well diſpute it in his 57. chapter of his firſt booke of <hi>More:</hi> For the Divine light, is inſupportable above all to all his Creatures, even to the moſt perfect, following that which the Apoſtle ſets downe in the 1 of <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>God dwels in light in acceſſible, that no man can ſee:</hi> So that it is to us in ſtead of darkneſſe, as the brightneſſe of the Sun is to Moulds, Owles, and other night birds: which darkneſſes are the reveſtments, and as the borders and cloiſters of the light; for repreſent to your ſelves ſome Lanthorne placed on the top of a mountaine: all round about it as from the Center to the Circumference, it ſhall ſpread its light equally, as farre as it can extend it: ſo that at the laſt darkneſſe will terminate it, <hi>for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is nothing elſe, but the abſence and privation of light:</hi> Even the very ſame, the exteriour man, carnall, animall, is the coverture; yea darkneſſe of the interiour ſpirituall: after the manner or faſhion of ſome Lanthorne of wood, or ſtone, and other darke matter, which keeps that the light there ſhut in, could not ſhew forth its light, the Lanthorne ſymbolizing to the body, and the light within to the ſoule. But if the body bee ſubtiliated to an aethereall nature, from thence it comes to paſſe, as if the Lanthorne were of ſome cleare Cryſtall, or of tranſparent horne: for then the ſoule and its functions, do ſhine there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153427:15"/> openly without obſtacle. Sith then, to the one of theſe two, namely to the inner man, is attributed fire, that anſwers to the ſoule, and ſalt to the outward man, which is the body: as the ſacrifice or man animall is the reveſtment of the ſpirituall deſigned by the Man, and by Fire: The veſtment of this Fire will bee Salt, in which, fire is potentially ſhut in; for all Salts are of the nature of fire, as being thereof begotten. <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, that ſalt is made of every thing that is burned, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, participant of its proprieties, which are to purge, dry, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der corruption, and unboile; as wee may ſee in all ſalted things which are as it were halfe boiled, and are kept longer uncorrupt then raw, alſo in potentiall burning irons which burne, and are nothing elſe but Salt.</p>
               <p>Will it bee lawfull for us here to bring one entire paſſage of <hi>Rhaſes</hi> in a book of the <hi>Secret Triplicity?</hi> for it is not common to all, and wee will ſtrongly inſiſt on this number by reaſon of the three Fires and three Salts, whereof wee pretend to Treat. So that there is a Myſtery in this number of 3 that muſt not bee forgotten, for that it repreſents the operation, whereof Fire is the Operator; for 1, 2, 3, makes 6. the 6 dayes wherein God in the Creation of the world perfected all his workes, and reſted the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>There are (ſaith <hi>Rhaſes</hi>) three natures, the firſt whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee knowne nor apprehended, but by a deepe elevated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: This is, that all-good God Almighty, Author, and the firſt Cauſe of all things; The other is neither viſible, nor tangible, although men ſhould <hi>bee all contrary;</hi> that is to ſay, heaven in its rarity. The third is the Elementary World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all that which is under the Aethereall Region, is perceived and known by our ſenſes. Moreover God which was from all aeternity, and with whom before the Creation of the world, there was nothing but his proper name knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his Sapience; that which hee created on the firſt day, was the water wherein hee mingled earth, then came hee to procreate after, that which had a beeing here below. And in theſe two Elements, thicke and groſſe, perceptible to our ſenſes, are comprehended the two other, more ſubtill and rare, Aire, and Fire. Theſe four bodies being, (if we muſt call them bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) bound together with ſuch a minglement, that they could
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:153427:16"/> ot perfectly ſeparate. Two of them are fixed, namely, Earth nd Fire, as being dry and ſolid; the other two volatil, Water, and Aire, which are moiſt and liquid: ſo that each Element is agreeable to the other, two wherewith is bounded and encloſed, and by the ſame meanes, containes two in it ſelfe, the one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, the other not, the which participates of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and therefore there are two ſorts of Waters, the one pure, ſimple, and elementary; and the other common, which we uſe in Lakes, Wels, Springs, and Rivers, raines and other impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Aire. There is likewiſe a groſſe Earth, filthy and infected; and a Virgin Earth, cryſtalline, cleare, and ſhining, contained and ſhut up in the Center of all the compoſed Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; where it remaines reveſted, and covered with many foldings one upon another. So that it is not eaſie to arrive there, but by a cautelous and well graduated preparation by fire. There is alſo a fire which is maintained almoſt of it ſelfe, and as it were of nothing, ſo ſmall is the nouriſhment that it needeth; whence it comes to bee more cleare and lucent, and another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, darke, and burning, and conſuming all that to which it is fixed, and it ſelfe at laſt. And Aire on the other ſide pure and cleane, with another corruptible full of legerity, for of all the Elements, there is none more eaſie to be corrupted then the aire; all which ſubſtances ſo contrary and repugnant, mingled with elementary bodies are the cauſe of their deſtruction: wherefore of neceſſity that which is pure and incorruptible, muſt be ſeparated from its contrary, the corruptible and impure, which cannot be done but by fire, the ſeparator and purificator. But the three liquid Elements, Water, Aire, and Fire, are as inſeparable one from the other, for if the Aire were diſtracted from the fire, the fire which hath therefrom one of its principall maintainments and food, would ſuddenly extinguiſh, and if the water were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Aire, all would bee in a flame. That if the Aire ſhould be quite drawne from the water, for as much as by its legerity, it holds it ſomewhat ſuſpended, all would be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Likewiſe if Fire ſhould be ſeparated from the Water, all would bee reduced into a deluge. For three Elements never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe may well bee disjoined from the Earth, but not wholly, there muſt remaine ſome part to give conſiſtence to the Body: and render it tangible, by the meanes of a moſt ſubtill and thinne
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153427:16"/> portion thereof, which they will elevate with them, out of this groſs thickneſs that remaines below, as wee may ſenſibly ſee in glaſs, which by an induſtrious Artifice of fire, is depured of the darkneſſe that was in the aſhes, to paſſe from thence to a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent clearneſſe, which is of the nature of Fire and indiſſoluble Salt, accompanied with a firme and ſolid thickneſſe, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſpiration nor pores.</p>
               <p>But wherefore ſhould wee not hereto file all in one traine, thoſe ſo excellent Meditations of <hi>Zohar,</hi> ſith all depends on the ſame purpoſe? <hi>God formed Adam of the ſlime of the earth,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew, <hi>God formed man duſt of the earth;</hi> which word of forming belongeth properly to Potters, who faſhion of earth all that they thinke good. And touching the duſt, this is but to abate our pride, with which wee may bee ſwolne, when wee conſider the vile and corruptible matter, whereof wee are made, in reſpect of our bodies, which is nothing elſe but mire and dirt. Conſider then three things (ſaith <hi>Zohar</hi>) and thou ſhalt not fall into tranſgreſſion. Remember from whence thou art come, of ſuch filthy and foule ſtuffe, and whither thou muſt at laſt returne, to duſt, wormes, and rottenneſſe; and before whom thou art to render an account, and reaſon of all thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and comportments; who is the ſoveraigne Judge, the King of all, who leaves no tranſgreſſion unpuniſhed, nor good worke irrecompenſed. <hi>Adam</hi> then and all his poſterity were formed of the duſt of the earth, which had before beene moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the fountaine or vapour, which was highly elevated by the Sunnebeams to water and to ſoften the earth: For the Earth being of it ſelfe cold, and dry, is altogether ſterill and fruitleſſe, if it be not impregned with moiſture and heat, whence proceed fecundity. So that <hi>Adam</hi> was compoſed of Earth and Water mingled together: Theſe two elements betoken a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty in him, and double formation, the one of the body, in regard of this age; the other of the ſoule, in another world. Water ſhewes the celeſtiall Meditation whereto our ſpirit may exalt it ſelfe; and the earth of it ſelfe immoveable, and that can never budge from below, nor willingly mingle with the other three volatil elements, by reaſon of its extreame dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that it doth but grow hard by the action of fire, and makes it ſelfe more contrary and untractable by the ſpirit of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153427:17"/> contradiction hard and refractory from the fleſh, againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo that ſhee ſhould reject the water which men thought to put therein, if it were not by meanes of the ſubtill Aire, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and mingling therewith, and penetrating into the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt parts: which being ſuckt within the water, forces the earth to feed on it, to incloſe it in her ſelfe, as if ſhee would detaine it priſoner, and by that meanes remaines great; as the female by a male: for every ſuperiour thing in order and degree, holds the place of male, to that which is inferiour and ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Now if the Aire abſent it ſelfe, which aſſociates and unites them together, as being ſuppeditated and baniſhed, which is moiſt and hot, from the extreame dryneſſe and coldneſſe of the earth, it will force it with all its power to reject the water, and ſo reduce it ſelfe to its firſt dryneſſe; which we may perceive in Sand, which will never receive water, except it be quickly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Even ſo the earth is alwaies rebellious and contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of it ſelfe to bee mollified, be it by water, by aire, by fire; and after this manner there was a ſpirit of contradiction and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience introduced into <hi>Adam,</hi> by reaſon of the earth, whereof he was formed: as his Companion and himſelfe do ſhew, when by the ſuggeſtion of the Serpent, the moſt terreſtriall animall of all others, they ſo eaſily contradicted that extreame prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was given them of not taſting the fruit of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill: for the puniſhment whereof, it was ſaid to the Serpent, <hi>thou ſhallt eat earth all the dayes of thy life:</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reſumes in 65. chap. <hi>Duſt is thy bread:</hi> And to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that <hi>the earth ſhould produce nothing but thornes, briars, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> by means whereof, if he would live, he muſt cultivate it with the ſweat of his browes, till he returne to that from whence he was drawne, for being duſt hee muſt returne to duſt. But water which notifies Divine ſpeculations, diſirous to mingle, and unite with all things, to whom it gave beginning, and made them grow and multiply, is as the carriage or veſtment of the ſpirit, following that which was ſaid in the beginning of the Creation, that the Spirit of God was ſtretched over the waters, or as the Hebrew word <hi>Marachephet</hi> caries it, hovering over them, fomenting and vivifying them, as a Henne doth her Chickens, with a connaturall heat; for this word <hi>Elobim</hi> imports I know
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153427:17"/> not what, of heate and fire. By Water then the docill ſpirit, obedient to the invitations of the intellect, inſinuated it ſelfe into <hi>Adam;</hi> and by Earth the refractory, and opiniaſter, that ſpurneth againſt the pricke; for as the earth was the moſt ignoble Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all others, water rejecteth it, and diſdaineth it, and could agree with it, but as to a lee and excrement; but if the pure and neat ſpirit remaines within the water, where it made choice of its reſidence; for from the three natures of earth, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at leaſt never joines with the two, (that is to ſay) ſand, for its extreame dryneſſe that cauſeth a diſcontinuation of parts: and the dirt to be fatty and unctuous: there is not any thing elſe,<note place="margin">Argilla.</note> but ſlime only, with which ſome food and mingling which may bee thereof made, the water at laſt lets it reſide below, and it ſwimmes over: as being of a contrary nature, the one altogether immoveable, ſolid, and compact; the other fluent, removing, and gliding as bloud through the veines, wherein the ſpirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; who can eaſily bee elevated to bee of a fiery quality, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſoring upward: So that the water which notifies the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ſpirit, endeavours to deveſt it ſelfe of this externall coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation; for all coagulation is a kinde of death and wateriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; and would never more aſſociate therewith, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it ſelfe by reaſon of its contumacy; were it not that the ſoveraigne Maſter, and Lord <hi>Adonai</hi> by his providence, for the propagation of things, (as long as hee ſhall pleaſe to maintaine in beeing, this faire worke of his hands) conſtraine theſe two, Earth and Water, to agree in a ſort together, by its Angell or Miniſter that rules in the Aire. Man moreover hath towards himſelfe frank and free will in his full power and diſpoſition: <hi>The appetite of ſinne ſhall be under thee, and thou ſhalt have domination over it, Gen. 4.</hi> But if hee be adheering to the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> (that is to ſay) to carnall deſires and concupiſcences, whereunto he is moſt inclinable, he ſhall do nothing but evill. And if to the ſpirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by water, all that hee doth ſhall goe well. The River of God is filled with waters. And in the 44. of <hi>Iſaiah, I will powre out water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will powre out my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</hi> So that as long as the water doth ſuffer and remaine uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the earth, the good Spirit reſteth with man, by which wee are admoniſhed by the wiſe man, <hi>Prov. 5.15. to drinke waters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153427:18"/> out of our Ciſterne, &amp; rivers out of our own Wel.</hi> But when the earth by its rebellious and repugnant drought, rejecteth water, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth nothing therein but its hard and refractary obſtination, till that by meanes of the aire, the ſpirit that joines and unites them together (which are holy inſpirations) it bee newly remoiſtned and watered: By meanes whereof when wee have this good ſpirit of ſalutary water, whereof it is written in the 15 of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus, Thou ſhalt give him the water of wiſdome to drinke:</hi> wee muſt take heed of caſting it away, and to make our ſelves all dry earth and ſandy, which is not ſatisfied with water, and therefore produceth nothing.</p>
               <p>But all this is more clearly expreſſed in the Goſpell, where by the meanes of this fructifying water, our Saviour which is a Fountaine that is never dry, the holy Spirit commeth to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts that which moiſtneth the hardneſſe of the earth, watereth it, and dreſſeth it, to produce the ripe fruits of good and charitable works. <hi>The water which I will give you</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>ſhall be a Fountaine of living water, ſpringing up into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> Of this water the Prophets have clearely ſpoken, as <hi>David</hi> in the 36. <hi>Pſal. For with thee there is a Fountaine of life, and in thy light wee ſhall ſee light.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 36.6.</note> See how he joines water with light, which is fire; ſo that this digreſſion ſeemes to bee leſſe impertinent; and in the 12. of <hi>Eſay</hi> 3. <hi>You ſhall draw water with joy out of the wels of ſalvation.</hi> More <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. <hi>They have forſaken me, that am the Fountaine of living water, and have digged to themſelves Ciſternes, broken Ciſternes that will hold no water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this of <hi>Zohar</hi> (as above) are compriſed the principall ſecrets and actions of Fire, and of its contrary, the Patient, which is, Water: for the acts of Actives are in the diſpoſition of the Patient, (ſaid the Philoſopher;) for the effects cannot better be diſcerned then where they act. Fire then hath three propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: but in this reſpect, wee muſt argue the thing more deeply.</p>
               <p>As then, all that which is, are divided into 3, called Worlds, or Heavens, (it muſt not be thought ſtrange, if wee repeate the ſame more then once; for from thence proceed all the ſecret ſciences,) that is to ſay, the elementary here below, ſubject to perpetuall alteration, and viciſſitude of life, and of death; the Celeſtiall aloft, above the Circle of the Moone, incorruptible in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153427:18"/> reſpect of it ſelfe, as well for its purity, and uniformity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as for its continuall and equall motion; nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in praedominating the one or the other; which two conſtitute the Senſible world. There is afterward the Intelligible, abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from all corporeity and matter, which the Apoſtle cals the third World, where hee was raviſhed, this (ſaid hee) <hi>whether in the body or out of the body, God knowes,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. for not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the World and the Heaven, are put one for the other, but yet the Heaven for Man; <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, moſt part of the Fathers interpret it; and Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally for Heaven. As <hi>Origen</hi> ſets it forth, upon the 25 Treatiſe of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Mans heart is properly called Heaven, and the Throne not already of the Glory of God, as is the Temple, but of God properly.

That Corporeal Light proceeded from an Incorporeal Nature. The Celeſtial

               <p>The prophane Poets have divided the Senſible World into 3, for they never tooke much paines to penetrate into the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible: And aſſigned the ſuperiour part thereof, from the circle of the Moone upward, to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the low Terreſtriall to <hi>Pluto,</hi> and the middlemoſt, which is from the Earth to the Moone, to <hi>Neptune:</hi> which the Platoniſts call the Generative Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the humidity, impregned with Salt, which provoketh much to generation, according as the word <hi>Salacitas</hi> deſignes it, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> puts it in the 4 Queſtion of Naturall Cauſes, and in his Treaty of <hi>Oſiris:</hi> wherefore the ſaid Poets attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more fecundity to the ſaid <hi>Neptune,</hi> then to all the other Gods.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe 3 worlds furthermore, hath particularly its ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is double; the one common and triviall, the other myſticall and ſecret. The Intelligible world to our Theologie, and the Caballe the Celeſtial to Aſtrologie and Magie; and the elementary, to the Phyſiologie and Alchymie, which revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by the reſolutions, and ſeparations of Fire, all the more hidden, and darke ſecrets of natures, in three kindes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153427:19"/> for no man can know the compoſition of a thing that is ignorant of its deſtruction, ſaith <hi>Geber.</hi> But theſe three divine ſciences have beene by the depravation of ignorant and evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits turned aſide to a crying downe, that men durſt ſcarcely ſpeak thereof, but muſt preſently incurre the bruite of being an Atheiſt, Witch, or a falſe money-coyner. We ſay then, after <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras;</hi> All this our reaſon diſputes by a Journey of compoſition and reſolution, going this way and that way, up and downe. That all the Elementary ſcience conſiſteth in the mixtion and ſeparation of the Elements, which is perfected by fire, to which Alchymy turnes all: As <hi>Avicen</hi> declareth very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in his Treaty of <hi>l'Almahad,</hi> or Diviſion of Sciences. And <hi>Hermes</hi> in that of his 7 chapters, Underſtand yee ſonnes of the wiſe, the Science of the four Elements, whoſe ſecret apparition is no where ſignified, except they bee divided and compounded, becauſe out of the Elements nothing is made profitable without ſuch a Regiment; for where Nature ends her operations, there Art begins. Take ſuch a compoſed Elementary, what you will, herbe, wood, or other the like, upon which, fire may exerciſe its action, and put it in an Alembic or Cornue;<note place="margin">Cornue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> firſt let them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the water, and afterwards the oyle, if the fire bee moderate, if more preſſed and reinforced, both together: but the oyle will ſwimme above the water, which may eaſily bee ſeparated by a fonnel of Glaſſe. This water is called <hi>Mercury,</hi> which of it ſelfe is pure and cleane; and oyle, the ſulphur, aduſtible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that corrupts every compounded thing: In the bottome of the veſſel will reſt the Aſhes, of which by a forme of lee, with water the Salt will bee extracted, and after you have withdrawn the water with <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> as men call it: for the oily unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities do not mount by this degree of fire, no more doth the Salt, but much leſſe; and the indiſſoluble Earths ſtript of all their humidities proper to vitrifie: for ſaith <hi>Geber,</hi> every private thing by its owne humidity doth performe none but a vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory fuſion. So there are two volatill Elements, namely the liquid, Water and Aire, which is Oyle, for all liquid ſubſtances naturally ſhunne the fire, which elevates the one, and burnes the other. But not thoſe two which are dry and ſolid; which are Salt, wherein is contained Fire, and pure Earth, which is Glaſſe: over whom the fire hath no power but to melt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153427:20"/> them. See there the four Elements redoubled, as <hi>Hermes</hi> cals them, and <hi>Raymund Lullius</hi> the great Elements; for as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Element conſiſts of two qualities, theſe great Elements redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Mercury, Sulphur, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> participate of the two ſimple Elements, (to ſay better) of all four; according to the more, or the leſſe, of the one, or of the other; <hi>Mercury</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more of the <hi>Aire,</hi> to which it is attributed; Oyle or <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> of the Aire; <hi>Salt,</hi> of Fire; and <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> of the Earth, who findes it ſelfe pure and cleane in the Center of all the compoſed Elementaries, and is the laſt to reveale it ſelfe exempt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Of this ſort by the Artifice and operation of Fire, and of its effects, we depure all infections and filth, even to reduce them to a purity of incorruptible ſubſtance from this time forward; by the ſeparation of their inflamable, and terreſtriall impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for (ſaith <hi>Geber</hi>) the whole intention of the Operator, is verſed in this that the groſſer parts being caſt away, the worke may bee perfected with the lighter; which is to mount from the corruptions here below, to a purity of the Celeſtial world, where the Elements are more pure and eſſential, fire there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating which is the chief of all others. Hitherto touching <hi>Alchymie,</hi> and wherein ſhee is verſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magick</hi> for the Celeſtial world, was in times paſt, a holy and venerable Science, which <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Charmis</hi> cals the true Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of the ſoule; and in the firſt, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> puts it, that it was wont to ſhew the Elders of the great Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to teach them to reverence God, to forme their temporall domination according to the patterne of the order and policy of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. But it is nothing elſe properly (as <hi>Orpheus</hi> ſaith) but a forme of marriage of the ſtarry heaven with the earth, whither hee darts his influences, by which ſhee impregnes comming from the Intelligences who aſſiſt therein; and an application of agent vertues upon the paſſive, and that without the cooperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Daemons the moſt part, evill, falſe, and deceptive, yet ſome more then others; with which it is thought that the three wiſe Kings, <hi>Magi,</hi> that came ſo farre to adore Jeſus Chriſt, were willing to have ſome acquaintance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>The third is that which men call <hi>Caballe,</hi> or reception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men left it there verbally, and by mouth from hand to

The other is of <hi>Mercavah,</hi> or of the Throne of God, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> principally treats of, whoſe viſion is almoſt all of fire. So much is this Element throughout the whole holy Scripture appropriated to Divinity, as one of the moſt perfect and neare ſymboles and markes in things ſenſible; by meanes whereof wee are ſo elevated, that by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, or <hi>Homers</hi> golden Chaine, we come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things ſpirituall and intelligible; <hi>for the inviſible things of God from the Creation of the World, are clearely ſeene, being underſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But in Mans formation, hee inſiſted much further therein then in all the reſt, ſaith he; <hi>Let us make man after our Image and Similitude, hee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him male and female, and formed him duſt of the earth, afterward breathed in his face the ſpirit of life, and hee was made a living ſoule.</hi> In which are touched 4 or 5 particularities. So <hi>Cyrill</hi> obſerves it. After the ſame manner then, as the Image of God is the world, ſo the image of the world, is man: therein there is ſuch a relation of God with his creatures, that they cannot bee well comprehended, but reciprocally one by the other, for all the Senſible nature, (as <hi>Zohar</hi> hath it) in regard of the intelligible, is as that of the Moone, towards the Sunne, who thereinto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberates its light: or as the light of a Lampe or torch, which parteth the flame faſtned to the weik, which is therein nouriſhed by a groſſe matter, viſcous, aduſtible, without which this ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153427:21"/> and light could not communicate it ſelfe to our ſight, nor our ſight comprehend it: And likewiſe the glory and eſſence of God, which the Hebrewes call <hi>Sequinah,</hi> could not appeare but in the matter of this Senſible world, which is an image or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne thereof. And it is that, which God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>You ſhall not ſee my face, you ſhall ſee my binder parts.</hi> The face of God is his true Eſſence in the intelligible world, which no man ever ſaw, except the <hi>Meſſihe, I did ſet the Lord alwayes before mee, Pſal.</hi> 16.8. And his poſteriour parts are his effects in the Senſible world. The ſoule likewiſe cannot bee diſcerned and knowne, but by the functions it exerciſeth in the body whilſt it is annexed thereunto: <hi>By which Plato was moved to thinke that ſoules could not conſiſt without bodies, no more then fire without water.</hi> So that after long revolutions of times, they ſhould come againe to incorporate themſelves here below: whereunto adheres that in the 6 of <hi>Virgils Aeneads.</hi>

               <p>But this ſavours a little of new-birth, and <hi>Pythagorean</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of ſoules into bodies, in which <hi>Origen</hi> was likewiſe out of the way, as may be ſeene in his booke of Princes, and in Saint <hi>Jeromes</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Avitus.</hi> But more ſincerely <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the reſt an impious adverſary, a Calumniator of Chriſtianiſme; that for the perfect beatitude of ſoules, they muſt: ſhunne and fly all bodies. So that, when the ſoule ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged from all corporal affections, and when it ſhall returne to its Creator, in its firſt ſimplicity, it hath no great deſire to fall againe into the hands and calamities of this age, when the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be left unto it free.</p>
               <p>From the Intelligible world then, it runnes downe into the Celeſtial, and from thence to the Elementary, all that which the ſpirit of man can attaine from the knowledge of the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects of Nature, which Art intimates, in what ſhee can, whence by the revelation of theſe rare ſecrets, by the action of fire, the moſt part is magnified, the glory and magnificence of him who is the firſt motor and author thereof; for mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding according to <hi>Hermes,</hi> is as a Glaſſe where we come

               <p>So each of theſe three worlds, which have their particular ſciences, hath alſo its fire, and its ſalt apart: both which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us namely of <hi>Moſes</hi> his fire in the heaven. And the Salt for its firme conſiſtence and ſolidity to the earth. What is this Salt? aske one of your Chymicall Philoſophers; a ſcorched and burned earth, and congealed water, by the heat of fire, poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially encloſed therein. Moreover Fire is the operatour here below, in the workes of Art, as the Sunne and Celeſtiall Fire is in them of that nature; and in the intelligible, the holy Spirit by the Hebrewes called <hi>Binah,</hi> or Intelligence, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſignes ordinarily by fire, and this ſpirituall fire, or igneal ſpirit, with the <hi>Chomah</hi> the verbe, where the Sapience attributes to the Sonne, Wiſdome, the Artiſt of all things, taught mee, are the fathers operators. By the word of the Lord were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens firmed, and all their beauty by the ſpirit of his mouth; from whence that maxime of the Peripateticks differs not much, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worke of Nature is a worke of Intelligence.</p>
               <p>Behold the three fires, whereof we pretend to ſpeake, of which there is none more common amongſt us then the elementary here below, groſſe, compoſed, and materiall; that is to ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, faſtned to matter; nor on the the other part leſſe known. That which is of him, from whence he came, and whither hee goes; reducing in an inſtant all to nothing: aſſoone as his nouriſhment failes him; without which he cannot conſiſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but goes as hee comes, being all in the leaſt of his parts: So that he can in leſſe then nothing, multiply to infinity, and in leſſe then nothing empty it ſelfe: for one little waxe light will at pleaſure enkindle the greateſt fires we can imagine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loſſe or diminution of its ſubſtance:
<q>Though they take a thouſand, yet nothing periſheth:</q> And in the third of Saint <hi>James, Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth;</hi> yea one onely ſmall ſparkle of fire, would preſs in the twinckling of an eye, all the immenſe hollow of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,

But men may ſay the ſame, that neither <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor other Grecians of his time knew ſo well the fire and its effects, at leaſt wiſe not ſo exactly as did (ſo long while after) the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> by <hi>Alchymie,</hi> on which all the knowledge of fire dependeth, The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſaid, that it was a raviſhing and inſatiable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, that devoures that which taketh birth and increaſe, and at laſt it ſelfe; after it is therewith well fedde and gorged: when there is no more to feed or nouriſh it; for that having heat and motion, he cannot paſſe from food and aire to breath therein; if for want hereof, it remaines at laſt extinct, with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was fed: All things proper to animate ſubſtances, and which have life, for life is ever accompanied with heat and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Suidas</hi> thereupon formed ſuch a contradiction, that not onely animals, but all that which take nouriſhment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, tend to a certaine butt, whither being come, it ſtayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing any further, where neither nouriſhment nor increaſe of fire are limited nor determined; for the more is adminiſtred, ſo much the more it would have, and grow every day greater: for neither the one nor the other can be limited, as do theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. Then by conſequent it muſt not be put in their ranke; So that the motion of fire ſhould rather be called generation, then nouriſhment or growth; for there is but that one element, that nouriſheth and increaſeth it. In the others, that which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounds therein is by appoſition, as if you would joine water to water, or earth to earth; you ſhall never do the ſame to fire, to thinke to make it greater by joining thereunto other fire, but by the appoſition of matter, upon which it may bite and exerciſe its action, as wood and other like things, which perforce muſt turne into its nature, and ſo it augments it ſelfe.

And there was amongſt them, no crime more capitall and irremiſſible, then to caſt any dead carkaſſe or other uncleanneſſe therein, or to blow it with your breath, for feare to infect it, but they did it to give it aire, for in all this they hazzarded no leſſe then life; as to quench it otherwiſe in water: So that if any one had perpetrated any grievous forfeit, to obtaine grace and pardon therein; the beſt expedient then was, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> puts in his firſt Treatiſe of the firſt cold, to put himſelfe in running water with fire in the hand, threatning to quench it in the water if they did

And from thence it became a common proverbe mentioned in <hi>Suidas:</hi> I am a <hi>Perſian,</hi> borne of <hi>Perſian</hi> parents; what a ſtrange <hi>Perſian?</hi> yea Sir, for us to pollute fire, it is ſharper then cruel death. But all this which may bee ſaid of fire, and by the meanes thereof, hath not yet been revealed, nor knowne by men: Is there any thing more admirable then Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, ſo eaſy to make, and conſiſting of ſo few ingredients; and ſo common Sulphur, Saltpeter and coale? which ſeeme to have been myſtically deſigned by the Aegyptians, by the three Celeſtial powers, whence they alledge Thunder, Lightning, Tempeſts, to be conducted and governed, <hi>Jupiter, Veſta,</hi> and <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> By <hi>Vulcan,</hi> Sulphur; by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Saltpeter, full of aire and winde, as <hi>Raymund Lullius</hi> puts it, who well knew it, and its nature, and its, effects if he would have diſcovered them; and by <hi>Veſta</hi> Coale; as well for the Terreſtreity that is in it, as for that it is incorruptible, being able to keepe it many thouſands of yeares within the ground, without alteration or ſpoiling, which was the cauſe that they made a place and ſtage for it, in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſiu:</hi> Saltpeter is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Aire; becauſe it is as of a meane diſpoſition of nature, betwixt Sea water, and the Fire, or Sulphur, whereof it participates, for that it is ſo inflamable, and ſaltiſh, on the other ſide, reſolving it ſelfe into moiſture, and water, as the Salts do; from whence it hath bitterneſſe and acuity; and as the incloſed and retained aire, within the clouds, doth breake and lighten by the impetuoſity of Thunder, the ſame doth Saltpeter: But this will come to better purpoſe hereafter in Salts. Moreover hee that can make powder compoſed of certaine proportions of Sulphur and Saltpeter, and in ſtead of Coale, with the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial ſcurf of Antimony, which muſt be ſeparated by frequent and reiterated ablutions of lukewarme water; may come to an artificiall fire, not to bee diſdained; of a powder, that will give a ſmall report; 'tis true that it is not ſo impetuous and full of force, as the common. In regard of the invention of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the relations of <hi>China</hi> do cary, that by their ancient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles it is found out, that they have had the uſe of it more then 1500 yeares; as alſo of printing. <hi>Roger Bacon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1500 years.</note> the famous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153427:24"/> Engliſh Philoſopher, who writ above 300 yeares agoe, in his booke of the admirable power of Nature and Art, ſets downe, that with a certaine compoſition imitating lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Gideon</hi> was wont to feare his Enemies with. And yet that it is not formally as it is written in the 7 of <hi>Judges,</hi> yet it is ſaid nevertheleſſe more then ſixſcore yeares before the divulgation of Gun-powder; ſee his word: furthermore there may bee made perpetuall lights and bathes, burning without end, for we have knowne many things that are not burned, but purified; but beſides theſe, there are other ſtupendious things of Nature and Art; for ſounds may be made in the aire, like thunders, and of greater horror then ſuch as are made by nature. And a little matter adapted to the quantity of a thumb, makes a horrible ſound, and ſhewes a vehement coruſcation; and this may bee done many wayes, by which every City and Army may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; after the manner of <hi>Gideons</hi> Artifice, who with broken pitchers and lamps, fire breaking out with ineffable fragor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Army, with only 300 men. Theſe may be Granadoes and fire pots. And to be ſhort, nothing could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree on all points to Gun-powder; but theſe good men foreſeeing the ruine that ſuch things might bring, made too great conſcience to reveale it. To the purpoſe of perpetuall fires, by meanes of moſt long durance; <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> in his notes upon <hi>Pliny,</hi> relates that in his time there was an old Sepulchre opened in the Territory of <hi>Padoua,</hi> and therein found a little Coffer, where there was a Lampe yet burning, although that according to the inſcription it muſt have beene more then 500 yeares ſince it was lighted.<note place="margin">500</note> So that by this reckoning, it ſhould not bee altogether impoſſible to make fires, that will not be put out; for wee ſee the ſame in many ſorts of that which men call Grec; whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as it is reported heretofore compoſed a Treatiſe, which could not bee quenched with water, chiefly Sea water, by reaſon of the fatty and unctuous Salt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled therewith, but they grow worſer, and waxe more fiery.

But ſome will ſay that that is alſo a fable; I will leave others to decide it, and I will tell you what befell mee, ſeeking nothing leſſe then that, to meet with a ſubſtance, conducted thereunto, by graduall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of fire: which being bound faſt within a Viall of glaſſe and ſealed with <hi>Hermes</hi> his Seale, that no aire could any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, might be kept 1000 yeares (after the manner of ſpeech) in the bottome of the Sea: and opening it at the termination of ſo long a ſeaſon, or when you ſhall pleaſe, you ſhall therein finde a ſuddaine fire, (which when it ſents the aire) will light matches.

               <p>Theſe two fires then, the high and the low, who do know themſelves, and ſo one another, have beene no leſſe unknowne to the Poets, for <hi>Homer</hi> in the 18 of his Iliads, having placed <hi>Vulcans</hi> forge in the eighth ſtarry heaven, where he is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Artiſans endowed with ſingular prudence, and who

               <p>To ſhew that there is fire in the one, and the other Region, the Celeſtial, and Elementary; but diverſly: Men make more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over four ſorts of fire; that of the intelligible world, which is all light; the Celeſtiall participates of heate and light; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary of light, heate, and ardour; And the infernall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the intelligible, with ardor and burning without light; we ſee Lanthornes upon Mountaines that burne on the inſide, and other like called <hi>Vulcans.</hi> And it is a thing very admirable, as one of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> quoteth, that Sulphur &amp; Pitch that are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and eaſy to take fire, and continue ſo little in their combuſtion being expoſed to the aire, reſtrained nevertheleſſe within the Earths intrails, it ſeemes they there renew themſelves, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by their owne conſumption, although their heat and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bee there much more violent without compariſon, then here above. According as wee may ſee in Mountaines that burn for ſo many continued ages, and hot Bathes. This ſeemes to emancipate from the common order of Nature by a ſecret diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Divine providence, who will have them continue ſo; till the ſcurf and impurity of this inferiour world be extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with this infected ſtinking and corruptible odor; and to baniſh it from hence and ſend it backe to hell for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and torment of the damned; whereof it is written in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>There where the Celeſtial fire is all clear and ſhining as a lamp, whoſe flame ſhould bee nouriſhed with water of Life, mingled with a certaine compoſition of <hi>Camphire, Salnitre,</hi> and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamative
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153427:26"/> matters. So that theſe combuſtible ſubſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are infinite varieties, may endure very long, but it is true that it will bee but a gentle and weak flame. And of the like, but more ſubtill without compariſon, the Celeſtiall bodies are nouriſhed and fed, that need but little nouriſhment, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching from ſpirituality. I can tell you, being at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time brought, to make the faſhion of a ſhining Sunne, in the darke,<note place="margin">P. 73.

Sea water is alſo good thereto, and much better then freſh water, how pure ſoever it may bee; It is the Salt mingled among that gives it this luminous bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to returne to our diſcourſe, ſome have thought that ſith the Starres receive nouriſhment, they ſhould alſo vaniſh in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine periods of time, and others come in their ſtead; which were no other thing then a ſeparation of their clearneſſe and light, with their Globe of ſubſtance more groſſe and materiall, by which they come to diſſipate themſelves, and to vaniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the heaven; as vitall ſpirits within the aire: whileſt they are abſented from ſome animated body, and leave it void of life. So that by this meanes, their Globe from this time forward would remaine darke as a Lampe, whereby light, which before gave it light, ſhould bee quenched for lacke of nouriſhment, or other accident. This light or luminous fire is in the Starres, as the bloud is in animals, or juice in vegetables, whereto <hi>Homer</hi> ſeemes willing to grant in the 5. of his Iliads, where he puts, that for as much as the Gods do not live by bread and wine, as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, but by <hi>Ambroſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar,</hi> ſo they have no bloud, but in lieu thereof,<note place="margin">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153427:26"/> ariſing by its attraction elevates the ſpirits of the earth, which are of two natures, (a moiſt vapour including, and a dry vapour included) are together exalted, (ſaith the Philoſopher in the 5. of his Meteors) the one hot and moiſt, as is the Aire and Water, potentially; this which is properly called Vapour; the other hot and dry, of the nature and power of fire, called Exhalation. The firſt reſolves into water, as raines, ſnowes, hailes, miſts, fogges, and other ſuch moiſt impreſſions as are formed of this vapour, in the middle Region of the Aire, for being groſſe and heavy, they cannot mount higher, but afterwards being thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and congealed by the cold that reſides there, they fall backe here below, more materiall then thoſe which were not mounted from thence, and at laſt, all do reſolve into water. The ſecond, called Exhalation, is ſubdivided into three kindes; the firſt, more viſcous, groſſe, and heavy, is that whereof your fires are formed, which are called <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Saint Herme;</hi> the <hi>foole fires,</hi> and the like, which cannot mount higher then the low Region of the Aire: the ſecond is a little lighter, more ſubtill, and depured, penetrating even to the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where thunders and lightnings are formed, the wandring ſtarres, <hi>barres</hi> of fire, <hi>cheurons,</hi> and other ſuch inflamations.<note place="margin">P. 75.</note> The third, is yet more dry and light, and more free from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is done as in the Animall, where the moſt pure bloud, comes from the Liver to empty it ſelfe through the Arteries into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153427:27"/> heart which conducts it to its laſt perfection for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spirits. But this muſt be underſtood, if theſe Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and vapours finde iſſue atwhart the pores and ſpongioſities of the Earth,<note place="margin">Tuffe p. 76. a kind of white Sand, or ſoft and brittle Stone.</note> to evaporate upwards. But if peradventure it meet with Tuffe, or Sand, or the like lets, and hindrances, which do contradict them, or let them, they ſtay there and wax thicke, for procreation of minerals: that is to ſay, a hot and a dry exhalation, in the nature of Brimſtone, and a moiſt vapour in the nature of Quickſilver; not vulgar, but a ſubſtance yet ſpirituall and full of fume, from the aſſembling of which two, in a ſubtill vapour, they come to procreate in themſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by a long continuance of time, metals, and meane mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, according to the purity or impurity of their coagulated ſubſtances; and the temperature, defect, or exceſſe of the heat that recocts them in the entrails of the earth. Without going from my intention of the foreſaid exhalations, I thought fit to touch a little upon an experiment whereunto I arrived by my induſtry, which I thinke will not be diſagreeable. Take good old Wine, and put therein a certaine quantity of Salnitre, and Camphire, in a Platter upon a fire pan, within a Cloſet well firmed, that aire cannot enter, and make it evaporate therein, and that there be no more covering then the thickneſſe of the backe of a knife, to give it ſo much aire as it muſt have, to make it burne. This being done, ſhut well your little window, that nothing may vapour out after you have withdrawne the diſh, or platter, from thence to 10. 20. or 30. yeares; provided that the aire do not enter, and that the winde blow not in; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thither a lighted waxe candle, you ſhall ſee infinite little fires capring as lightnings in the great heate of Summer, which are not accompanied with thunders and lightnings, nor with ſtormes, windes, and raines, having nothing but an inflamation of Aire, by reaſon of Saltpeter, and Sulphur, which are eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Earth.</p>
               <p>Before wee paſſe from our intention of vapours and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that no man doubts but do proceed from heat introduced within the earth by the continuall motion of the heaven round about, and of the Celeſtial bodies, whence light is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome heat that it darts thereinto: Let us come to the experiments next approaching to our ſenſible knowledge, wee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153427:27"/> ſee, that the fire leaves two ſorts of excrements, the one groſſers namely, Aſhes; remaining in the bottome of its aduſtion, that containeth Salt and Glaſſe; and the two fixed and ſolid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fire and Earth: The other more light, and ſubtill, which the fume carries upwards; that is, the Soote, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the two volatill and liquid Elements, called by the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> Mercury and Sulphur, and by the <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> Vapour, and Exhalation. By <hi>Mercury,</hi> is deſigned Water, or Vapour, and by <hi>Sulphur,</hi> Oile, and Exhalation; Of Salt and of Earths therein, there are found a very ſmall quantity, yet ſufficient, thereby to perceive how the four Elements are found out in the reſolution of all the compoſed Elementaries: Take then the Soote of Chimney, but of that which ſhall mount higheſt in a very long Chimney pipe, and in the very top, where it muſt bee moſt ſubtill, thereof fill a great Cornue, or an Alembic two parts of three, then apply thereunto a great recipient, which you wrap about with linnen wet with freſh water. Give fire by ſmall quantities, the water and the oil will diſtill together, although the water ought in order to iſſue out firſt. After that, all theſe two liquors ſhall paſſe through the Recipient, and when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe ſhall ariſe, increaſe your fire with faggot ſtickes well dryed, or other like, continuing it for 8 or 10 houres, ſo long that the earths which ſhall reſt in the bottome bee well calcined: but for that they are in ſmall quantity put to more Soote, and continue it as aforeſaid, untill you have earth enough which you ſhall take out of the Alembic, which you ſhall put into a little earthen pot, of <hi>Parris,</hi> not ſmoothed, or in a little hollow pot. The water and oile, which you ſhall have diſtilled may be eaſily ſeparated by a glaſſe fonnell, where the water will ſwimme above the oile: This done you ſhall rectify your water by <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> by rediſtilling of it two or three times; for oile doth not mount by this degree of fire but by Sand; keepe them aſunder upon the earths, that ſhall be calcined within the ſaid pot or cruſet, put their water thereon a little warme ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with a ſpit, ſo long till the Salt which ſhall therein bee revealed by the fires action, do totally diſſolve it ſelfe into this Water; withdraw it by diſtillation, and the Salt ſhall bee left you in the bottome, of the nature of <hi>Salarmoniac,</hi> ſo that by preſſing it, it will elevate it ſelfe. But of this more plainely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153427:28"/> hereafter in its owne place, when we ſhall ſpeake of Salt. Of Earthes wee need not take much care, for wee muſt ſeeke for the beſt in the Aſhes, as alſo fixed Salt. So by the meanes of Water, extracted out of aſhes (we will here a little paſſe from Soote, a little better to declare the ſubject of Earthes.)</p>
               <p>In this Element the more groſſe and materiall of all, which wee call Earth, we muſt conſider three ſubſtances; the Hebrewes alſo have better diſtinguiſhed them then we, by giving them 3 names, <hi>Erehs, Adamah,</hi> and <hi>Jabaſſah. Erehs</hi> is properly durt or mud, <hi>Jabaſſah</hi> ſand, and <hi>Adamah</hi> clay, waſh of the common earth with water, and powre it ſuddainly into another veſſell, with the ſlime that it hath gathered; reiterate it ſo long, that there remaine no more in the bottome but Sand, in the Scripture called <hi>Arida: And his hands laid the foundation of the earth, Pſal.</hi> 94. where he properly uſeth the word of laying a foundation, becauſe that Sand is the ſubſiſtence, and retention of the earth, where it is mingled with ſlime by a certaine providence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtrengthen it againſt the moiſture of water, as wee ſee in Morter, where wee adjoine ſand with chalke, for feare leſt it melt, and diſſolve into moiſture. It ſerves alſo, to give it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe, for that Sand is very heavy, <hi>A ſtone is heavy, and ſand burdenſome, or weighty, Prov.</hi> 27. But the ſlime is lighter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in minerals, vegetables, animals, are procreated, as wee ſee by experience, by putting pure ſlime to the <hi>Erthree;</hi> for in leſſe then three weekes, you will finde therein ſmall ſtones, herbs, wormes, and ſnailes, and other little beaſts, producted therefrom. Of the nouriſhment remaining that theſe individuals ſhall bee, as that of Sand, deprived of all humidity; accordng to what wee ſee in Earths, which having beene too much cultivated, and ſowed, without bettering of them, are reduced from being fertill, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they were, and become ſandy and ſterill; for Sand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing, as wee ſee in Deſerts and Sea coaſts: whence comes this proverbe, <hi>(You plough the Sands)</hi> for a vaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable labour: for of the two qualities, whereof each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment participates, there is one that is more proper to it, and the other appropriated: Dryneſſe is the proper quality of the Earth, for that cold is more proper to Water: wherefore is it that the Earth, as aforeſaid, is called in Hebrew <hi>Jabaſſah,</hi> and in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153427:28"/> is more wateriſh; for of the groſſeneſs of the water, earth was made, ſaith <hi>Hermes;</hi> as wee may ſee in ſnow, in hail, in raine, or with water ſo condenſed, there is much ſlime mingled, of which (as aforeſaid) every thing here in the earth below is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Man himſelfe according to his body, was formed of this ſlime; and from thence it followeth that all the fertility of the earth comes from Water. <hi>God created all the buddes of the earth before they grew, and all the herbes of the field before they brought forth ſeed; for the Lord God had not yet made it to raine upon the earth, but a miſt went up therefrom, that watered the whole face thereof.</hi> Or as the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Paraphraſt turneth it, <hi>Onkelos,</hi> in ſtead of ſource and fountaine, vapour and clouds, which are engendred from the vapours that the Sunne elevates here below to the height in the middle Region of the Aire, from thence to water the earth. But neither the ſlime, nor the ſand, nor the clay on the other ſide, are not each by it ſelfe, nor reduced together, are this virgin and pure earth, that is ſhut up in the Center of all the compoſed Elements, that is to ſay, in the bottome of them, for that produceth nothing, becauſe it is incorruptible: and that which cannot corrupt, cannot produce any thing that ſhould be ſubject to corruption; as we ſee in Fire, Salt, and Sand, which are of the nature of Glaſſe, all ſubſtances not onely incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their reſpect, but which preſerves from corruption, that wherewith they are mingled; witneſſe herbs, fruits, fleſh, fiſh, and other the like, which being ſalted or buried in Sand are thereby kept the longer. And in <hi>Mummies,</hi> of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine choked and buried in the Sands paſſing the Deſerts, which are preſerved whole many ſuits of yeares, even as well, nay better then if they had been enbalmed. So that this earth is formed of two incorruptible ſubſtances, Salt, and Sand, by meanes of the water whch is thereupon congealed; as wee ſee in this faire Cryſtalline Glaſſe, made of Salt, of glaſſe wort, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which they mingle ſand to retaine it; otherwiſe, in the great ſharpneſſe of fire that it muſt indure, to worke therewith, it would all vaniſh into ſmoake; wee depure and refine it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in cleare Cryſtalline, joining thereunto <hi>perigort,</hi> or <hi>ſinople</hi> made of Lead.</p>

For the acts of Actives are in the diſpoſition of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, where we ſee fire does divers effects in diſagreeable ſubjects, but not wholly contrary, and directly oppoſite; as when it blacks a coal, and white chalk where its vertue is imprinted, but all to the contrary; for fire by cuſtome is extinguiſhed by water, it is it, that in this reſpect inflames and renewes that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed and hidden in the chalk: whence a fair meditation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; that as fire is the ſymboll of life; water (that is its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) and extinguiſheth it, muſt be of conſequence the ſymboll of death; water naturally tending downwards, and fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wherein conſiſteth life.</p>

Which <hi>Seneca</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates in the 103 Epiſtle, The day that we fear ſo much, as the laſt of our life, is a renaſcence of an eternall day; let us then chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leave behind that which ſerves for nothing but a tedious charge. Why do we ſo much turn our backs, as if we had not been before this firſt frail body, in which we remain included and hid? we ſtruggle and temporize therein, to the beſt of our power, and not without cauſe, for we have been forced out by a endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our mother in bearing us; and we weep and lament when

And a little more Chriſtian-like, although a little before; I will lay down this body where I have found it, and clothed it, and will render my ſelf above to the immortall Gods, although I am not without them at this preſent, but whileſt I am detained here within this grievous maſſe of earth, in the low a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of mortality, my ſenſuality will fight and combat againſt this other better and longer life. Now as we have been for nine or ten months, ſhut up within our mothers belly, not to prepare therein for it ſelfe, but at laſt, to come to this place, whither we ought to be ſent, when we ſhould be perfectly accompliſhed and made fit to breath, and remain openly out of this cloſet, where we were formed. In like manner during the ſpace that we have run through from our infancy to old age, we dye to go whither another originall attends us, and a new ſtate of things. All this doth in nothing derogate from the Traditions of our Church, who celebrated for the nativity of Martyrs the day of their death and martyrdom.</p>

               <p>We have alledged heretofore, out of the 31. of <hi>Numbers</hi> 23 that which is ſaid of fire and water, the two purifying Elements, whereby in our baptiſms we are accuſtomed to put a little piece of wax light or match, which they make the Creature to hold when they hold it over the font, the Church being thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the pillar of fire which garded the Iſraelites, and the cloud (baptiſmall water) by day, whereunto ſutes that of Saint <hi>John,</hi> in the 3. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> That in reſpect of himſelfe he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with <hi>Water</hi> unto repentance, but he that commeth after, ſhall baptize you with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and with <hi>Fire,</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes; for fire is a mark of the Holy Spirit, by which grace is conferred, and deſcended upon the Apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt, in the form of fiery tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, although too ſuperſtitious therein, made great account of this Element, which they ſaid, was I know not what living thing, the moſt wiſe Fabricator of the whole univerſe, and of all that which is contained therein; to which purpoſe, as I alledged before out of the 7. of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> 24. that Wiſdome the Artiſt of all things taught me, that it is more moving then motion, for ſhe paſſeth through all things by her pureneſſe. Wherein two properties of fire are attributed to Wiſdome, Motion, and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And in ſumme eſteemed it to be a God, according to which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 8.

For as Salt (the ſame <hi>Zohar</hi> purſues it) hinders putrefaction, to which every corruptible thing is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo the Fire of Gods love, and of Gods knowledge, which is illightned in the ſoul, repurging it from all corporall coinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, cauſeth, that after it hath been duly purged and cleanſed, it remaines for ever in its purity, for as much as fire devours and conſumes the filthy ſcumme thereunto faſtned, cloathing it ſelfe with a new and pure fire, which it could not otherwiſe do. For if it were not ſo aſſiſted with this pure fire, the Cherubin which is committed to the keeping of the Gate of the City of <hi>Delices,</hi> with a fiery ſword, to forbid the approach to the tree of Life, would not permit it to enter therein; from whence the curioſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the knowledg of good and evill excluded our forefathers, and us with them hereditarily.</p>

If any mans work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward.

And at length ſhall be ſaved as by fire, becauſe nothing ſhall be able to remove it from this foundation upon which it ſhall be built. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, in his third Sermon upon the 118. <hi>Pſal.</hi> As good gold, even the very Church when it is burnt, receives not detriment, but its luſtre and reſplendency encreaſe more and more. The <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> eſteemed that when they voluntarily burned themſelves, the ſoul remained thereby repurged from all iniquities &amp; miſdoings, which conſumed by the flames as touching the body, which had power to move the Indian <hi>Calanus</hi> and ſome others to come from thence, (for God would not that we ſhould advance our dayes by one moment) who, at the time they receive him, he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth us, and cleanſeth us from all preceding faults.

               <p>So the proprieties of fire, are in the firſt place to ſhine and lighten, and that is, by it, common to the Sunne, but it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much ſurmounted. And afterwards to warm, digeſt and bake, which this luminary doth alſo primitively, as we may ſee in that the Earth produceth, but for that the naturall heat doth not bring them wholly for our uſe, to the laſt and perfect degree of maturity, fire for the moſt part ſupplyes its wants, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults; for the regard of the concocting of what we eat, for we

But this burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be made in a very cloſe veſſel, wherein we ſhall ſay more hereafter about Salt, and yet we will yet bring further another of our experiments which ought not bee diſregarded.

               <p>Every thing that diſſolveth it ſelfe, is of the nature of Salt and Alum, as <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, For air, take fine <hi>aqua vitae</hi> which you ſhall turn into a Celeſtiall blew, with a little turnſol; and for fire, the oil of Been, but for that it is more rare, take of Turpentine oil, which is made thus, Diſtill common Turpentine in <hi>Balneo Marie,</hi> there will mount up together both water and oil, ſo white

The three liquors will never mingle, what ever trouble you uſe to them; but will ſeparate themſelves diſtinctly, into leſſe then nothing, by ſwimming one above another: Of the Turpentine, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Alembique, you ſhall extract it by Sand, in a <hi>Cornue</hi> with a ſtronger fire, then by the bath, a thick red oil, which is moſt excellent balm: water and oil extracted by the bath are very ſerviceable alſo, in many accidents of Medicine and Chirurgery; only the white oil will make ſcars quickly fall away without pain, or evill impreſſion. But if with the water of the ſaid Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, you diſſolve ſalt of lead, you ſhall have yet a more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign balm. But we muſt a little better clear this: for ſith we treat here of fire, and of its effects, what hinders but that we may extend our ſelves at length upon many things which our long labour and experience have acquired? This oil of lead, was one of <hi>Raymond Lullius,</hi> his great ſecrets: &amp; of many other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſonages, who have as it were made conſcience to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it: for this hath been to them an entry of more admirable works. Some, as <hi>Riply,</hi> &amp; others, have taken the <hi>minium</hi> of lead, but it is too eaſie, &amp; of an uneaſie reſolution, as alſo ceruſe &amp; calcined lead. For my part I have found litharge, which is nothing elſe but lead, for a pound of litharge, you ſhall extract 14. or 15. ounces of lead: put them into powder, and poure thereon diſtilled boiling vinegar, ſtirring it ſtrongly with a ſtaffe, and ſodainly the vinegar will charge it ſelf, with the diſſolution of litharge: Evacuate the clear, and reiterate with new vinegar, ſo long till all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge be diſſolved: Evaporate the vinegar, which ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory as the water, untill the ſalt ſhall remain congealed in the bottom. Take thereof a good quantity, and put thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your <hi>Cornue,</hi> as much as it will hold half full: and put it on the furnace with an open breech: in the beginning with an eaſie fire chaſing away that which therein may appear a remainder of ſtrange humidity: And when the white fumes ſhall begin to appear apply thereunto a Recipient big enough, and lute it well in the Jointures: after reinforcing your fire by little and little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it become a very great one, and the <hi>Cornue</hi> buried in the aſhes, you ſhal ſee iſſue as a little continued torrent after the faſhion of a

So now this ſecret oil, whereof that which <hi>Raimond Lullius</hi> never more expreſly ſaid was towards the end of his ſhort Epiſtle, in theſe very terms. Out of black lead is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Philoſophers oil, of a golden color, or as it were: and know that there is nothing in the world more ſecret then it. That which remains in the <hi>Cornue,</hi> put burning charcoals upon it, and that will take fire as the match of a fuſee: whence you may draw a fair ſecret: for as long as it feels not the air, it will not flame, and it may diſſolve againe with vinegar, to doe as before. But ſalt of lead diſſolved in water, and yet better then Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, oil will reſolve to a greater quantity of oil; and thereof may ſee more ample marvailes.

It is not corrupted by clay, nor burnt with any burning thing: nor mortified or devoured, by any green colouring, or dividing water, there is nothing in it ſuperfluous or defective: There are (ſaith <hi>Hermes</hi>) ſeven Metallick bodies, of which the moſt worthy and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall is gold, attributed unto the Sun: from whence it hath its name, for the ſame that the Sun is to the ſtars, gold is toward the elementary bodies, what thing ſoever burning it can bee, cannot burne it, the earth cannot corrupt it, nor the water deſtroy nor alter, becauſe its complexion is tempered in heat, moiſture, coldneſſe and drineſſe, and there is nothing in it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous or deficient.

Even as a fearful man, and of ſmall reſolution, who at the encounter of a Serpent or other venemous beaſt, would grow ſuddainly pale, and come to change colour: The care, curioſity, and aſſiduous travell of infinite, rare, and meditating ſpirits, by the ſpace of 4 or 5000 years, have found in metals ſecrets without number, and yet knew not to do ſo well, but that they have left much more to enquire into, and to ſearch after: although there be but ſeven in all, comprehending therein running quick-ſilver.</p>

But all tends to denote that the heavenly myſticall <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, ſo much more excellent then the Jewiſh Synagogue, which was but a figure thereof. And certainely hee that would looke more narrowly thereinto, the Prophets never ſpake any thing improperly, even to the leaſt trade or mechanick arts; for in their raviſhments they ſaw things in their reall being, within the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheret</hi> or ſuperceleſtiall Sunne, which is a clear ſhining looking-glaſſe, a living ſource of all Idea's, as Idea's are of formes. This is furthermore well to be obſerved, for the regard of metals, which they aſſociate commonly iron and copper for their affinity; will iron make a covenant with iron from the North? and braſſe? for iron is eaſily changed into copper, by means of vitrioll, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them bed upon bed in a deſcenſory with a ſtrong fire of bellowes, ſo long till the iron grow liquid and melt into copper, having firſt moiſtned them with a little vineger, wherein there ſhould be diſſolved ſal niter, or ſalt peter, ſal alcali, and ſalt of tartar, with verdigreaſe. Otherwiſe put of vitriol in powder, and diſtill the water in a cornue, that which ſhall remaine calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the bottome, impoſt it with its water, and therein quench the glowing gads of iron, or filings of iron, you ſhall find them

Make them red in the fire, after diſſolve them three or four times with diſtilled vinegar, drying them every time, and the flakes will become red, diſſolve them againe in the ſame vinegar, and therein quench the gads or other iron work, as above ſaid.

               <p>Theſe flakes here are an entry to a higher work, and of more things for Chirurgery and Medicine. But all theſe practiſes (you may ſay) are long and troubleſome and rather chargeable then gainfull, and profitable. Alſo our intention here, is not to ſtretch to gaine, this booke is not to get brend, but to penetrate into the ſecrets of nature: from thence to mount and elevate his ſpirit to ſpirituall things, whereto ſenſible do ſerve as a ſtair or as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder; and there are no rarer conſiderations and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, then in fire, and metallique tranſmutations: Copper on the other ſide, is changed into ſteele; if it bee true that ſome <hi>Rabbines</hi> quote, upon that paſſage lately alledged out of the 15. of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 12. Iron and Braſs, the Prophet (ſay they) calleth Iron mixed with Braſſe, Steel, which ſheweth (for we muſt diſdain nothing of theirs) that Damake Steel was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Iron and Copper, that is to ſay, of Iron halfe covered in Copper, and ſoftned to reſtrengthen it the more by means of lead.

               <p>Make a little long trench within a barre of iron, and caſt thereinto melted lead, then make it evaporate with a ſtrong fire as of a coupelle.

There are yet other ſecret obſervations, which our intention is not to reveal all; it is enough to have attained to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims.</p>
               <p>Now for that there is ſuch an affinity between iron, and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they may eaſily be converted one into the other; the ſame may likewiſe be done with lead, and tinne, by means of Sal Armonaick, and of certaine incerative powders of Borax, Salt peter, ſalt of Tartar, Salalchali, and other the like, which are called Atinears. <hi>Panthee</hi> in his <hi>Voarchadumie,</hi> oil of glaſſe.

To be ſhort, there is not a point of locution figurative, more frequent in the Prophets, then thoſe that are drawn from metals and from fire, which for the reaſon of its proprieties and effects, as it is one of the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and neceſſary things of all others, according as it is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for it bakes our viands, it warms us, and doth revigour us againſt the colds; it clears and lightens in the darkneſs, in lieu of the ſuns brightneſſe, and other infinite uſages, and chiefly for the execution of arts and trades: Otherwiſe we may ſay that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iron, fire it ſelfe would as it were be almoſt unprofitable for this reſpect. And <hi>Plato</hi> doth not exempt one onely art from fire, but the pottery of clay, in the 3. of his Lawes, where he treats very excellently of the life of the firſt men; and although iron and copper had brought them commodities to civilize themſelves and to poliſh them to a more humane life. So that not without cauſe, theſe poor beaſtly Savages of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> did wonder in their groſſe underſtanding, how people in theſe parts, ſo well adviſed and induſtrious, for a little piece of gold or ſilver, unprofitable to all uſes, ſhould offer them ſo liberally hatchets, ſithes, reaphooks, and other iron work, commodious for all uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we may here likewiſe alledge to the contrary the hurts and incommodities that iron bringeth, for of it, are forged all offenſive arms, wherewith men ſhorten their dayes by their reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Maſſacres: for that, it is <hi>Mars</hi> his true Miniſter, and exterminator and ruine of mankinde, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> qualifies it in the 5. of the Iliads,

               <p>Which he could not do, at the leaſt very uneaſily without the means and aid of fire.

Its lawfull ſpouſe is <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which by conjugall love, brings him all or the greateſt part of his neceſſary commodities, by reaſon of <hi>Mars,</hi> which is iron. But for that he is his adultererer, he alſo deſtroyes the greateſt part of what ſhee procreates; and the husband maintains iron for a double uſe, good, and bad; for we muſt not meaſure the works of the Creator by their apparent incommodities or commodities. For God ſaw all that he had made, and they were very good; for this goes according as the Creatures apply it. Is there any thing more fair, more pleaſant or more delectable to the ſight, then a cleare ſhining flame? any thing that doth more rejoice then light? And on the other ſide, there is nothing more hurtfull, fuller of damage, nor more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then fire, which burneth and conſumeth all that comes neare it.

But this ruſt becauſe we are purpoſely falne upon it, it is not altogether unprofitable, though moſt wholſome to many good effects, as well within as without the body, beyond that which it doth in tinctures. Wherefore it will do no hurt to touch ſome thing therein in this place, and therein to reveal that which experience hath manifeſted unto us to be moſt rare, and moſt important, but this is handled divers wayes.

And St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> the evils that preſſe us here, doe compell us the ſooner to come to God. And that for our greater good, that God doth thus burn us by the fire of tribuation: that which was ſaid by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 26.3. <hi>Prove me O Lord, and examine mee, try my reins, and my heart:</hi> And in the 13. of <hi>Zach. verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as ſilver is refined, and I will try them as Gold is tried:</hi> For fire hath a double property, as hath been ſaid, the one to ſeparate the pure from the impure, and the other to perfect that which remains of the pure. Take away ruſt from ſilver, and it will go forth a moſt pure veſſell: But the propriety of theſe ſignifications is better kept in the Hebrew, then in any other tongue. Where the verb <hi>Szaraph</hi> is joined and attributed unto ſilver, which ſignifies, to melt, and to refine, and to Gold <hi>Baban</hi> to prove. The one denotes Gods in Elect an holy purity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by ſilver, the other by gold a perfection of conſtancy, which wee cannot know better then by proof: and from thence comes dignity and eternall glory, the one and the other acquired by the fire of Examination and of probation; for, as ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that which fire is towards gold and ſilver, the ſame is tribulation in our ſoules from which fire cleanſeth the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and uncleanneſſe, and makes them neat ſhining: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is ſaid in the 17. of <hi>Prov.

Let us then ſtudy to amend our ſelves by the fire of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by bearing it patiently; for if the pottery be not firmly ſtrengthened by fire, the water of temporall vanity will ſoften it and mingle it as durt.

And for as much as it participates more of light then any of the other Elements: that likewiſe acquires unto it a precellency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt: for the Earth being a body wholly without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dark and duskiſh; is by conſequent leſſe in dignity, as the ſettlement and lees of all others. Water becauſe it is clearer, is more worthy, and the Air yet more: But fire is that which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all, therefore it is lodged in a higher place, and nearer to the Region of the air: It is that, which <hi>Vincent</hi> no deſpicable Author, was pleaſed to ſay in his Philoſophicall Mirror, 2. Book, 33. chap. Every thing for as much as it participates more of light, ſo much the more it approacheth nearer to the Divine Eſſence, which is perfect light, by which God began the Creation of the Univerſe, or the firſt thing that hee ordained to bee made, was light: and to ſhew us, that wee muſt alwayes walk in light and not in darkneſſe. And on the contrary, how much more the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are diſtant from light, by ſo much they approach to their diſſemblance and deformity, which is a token of corruption. For as much as the parties of the compoſed Elements are homogeneall and homomaternall, or like one to another, ſo much leſſe are they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153427:52"/> corruptible and ſeparable, as wee may ſee in gold, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate ſubſtance of all, and which approacheth neareſt to fire: that which moved <hi>Pindarus</hi> from the beginning of his firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympian, to join theſe three, water, fire and gold together, water is beſt, gold, and ſhining fire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doe wee not ſee that at every end of a field almoſt that the Earth doth change nature and quality, and that there are infinite ſorts of them? Not ſo many of Water, Air is moſt like unto it ſelf: but if there bee any changes or alteration therein it is by accident, as if ſome maladies ſhould fall thereupon: which doe more readily adhere thereunto, becauſe of its rarity of ſubſtance then to any others. Fire is altogether exempt therefrom, being alwayes one, and in its al like to his parts, which are like to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, except the matter to which it doth adhere makes it vary. And this it is in which it comes neareſt to the Celeſtiall nature which is all Uniform in it ſelf, and ſo well regulated, that it hath nothing unlike: which maketh that the fire is repurgative above the reſt of his fellow Elements, to clear them and put in evidence. In the 12. of St. <hi>Luke</hi> our Saviour warneth his Diſciples to have their <hi>Lampes burning in their hands, that their light might come to ſhine amongſt men, that their good workes may bee ſeen, to glorifie their Father which is in heaven,</hi> for <hi>hee that doth ill hates the light,</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> ſaith is worſe to Malefactors, then <hi>the ſhadow of death.</hi> It is the ſame alſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> would ſecretly infer in the 3. of <hi>Gen.</hi> where hee makes God to walk <hi>at noon,</hi> which is the cleareſt light of the day. And the Apoſtle in the 1. of <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. ſaith that <hi>he dwells in light in acceſſible,</hi> without which all would be confuſedly folded up in hideous darkneſſe. Let us then take heed, that the light which hee hath pleaſed to put into our ſoul, be not obfuſcate and converted into black obſcurity: and that on this ſolid foundation which hee hath granted us of his knowledge, wee build not hay, wood, and chaffe, all things of themſelves obſcure and dark, in lieu of gold, ſilver, pretious ſtones, ſo clear, ſhining and bright. Let us hear again that which <hi>Zohar</hi> divinely diſcourſeth of, about fire and light, upon the Text of the 4. of <hi>Levit. Thy Lord God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire.</hi> That there is one fire which devoures another being the ſtronger, as wee may ſee in ſome burning firebrand, or torch, that which proceeds therefrom is of two ſorts: the one blew, attached to a black match, which retaineth it ſelf there nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153427:53"/> it ſelf from corruption. The other flame proceeding from the red inflamed Match is white, and the blew is white in the higheſt, as to return to the firſt originall: this <hi>Homer</hi> was not ignorant of, when in the 6. of his <hi>Odyſſes</hi> hee attributed to the <hi>Olympus</hi> a pure and bright ſplendor.</p>
               <p>Nothing ſhould better repreſent unto us the four worlds name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the white which is ſuperceleſtial, the blew celeſtiall, the match fired, the Elementary, and the burning darkneſſe, Hell: which abundantly ſhews us the body. Rednes, the vitall ſpirit, reſident in the bloud; the blew, the ſoul; the white, the intellect, and the divine character imprinted in the ſoul: and as the blew light doth quickly change into yellow, quickly into white, the ſoul alſo can doe the ſame according as it ſhall incline it ſelf to good or to evill: or whether ſhee follows the provocations of the fleſh or the invitations and exhortations of the intellect, following that which is written in the 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. <hi>If thou doe well, ſhalt thou not bee accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the dore. And unto thee ſhall bee his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi> The white flame is alwayes the ſame, without variation or change, as doth the blew: So the fire in this reſpect is fourfold. Black in the lower part of its weik, where the flame that is faſtened to it, is blew. Red in the top of the weik, and the flame white. This which relates alſo, to the four Elements, black, materiall, to the Earth: Blew more ſpirituall to the air, Red to fire, and white to water. For heaven is compoſed of fire and water, which is above the heavens. <hi>Let the waters that are above the heavens praiſe the Lord.</hi> Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe all this is but fire, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſon of <hi>Maynon</hi> declares very well in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Mor.</hi> chap. 31. where he ſaith that under the name of Earth are compriſed the four Elements, and by darkneſſe was underſtood the firſt fire: for it is ſaid in the of <hi>Deut. You have heard his words out of the midſt of fire,</hi> and then he adds of a ſodain, <hi>You have heard his voice out of darkneſſe:</hi> This fire moreover, was called the firſt fire, becauſe that is not it which is ſhining and clear, but it is only, ſo tranſparent to the ſight, as is the Air: and could not comprehend it ſelf therewith, for if it were ſhining wee ſhould in the night ſee all the air ſhine as fire. And for that the darkneſſe, which was firſt named, denoted fire, namely that whereof it is ſaid, that <hi>darkneſſe was upon the face of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153427:53"/> Abyſſe:</hi> becauſe the fire was under the three Elements; compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under this word <hi>Abyſſus.</hi> There are other darkneſſes which follow after: then when the ſeparation of things was made, and the Darkneſſes he called Night. All this, the foreſaid <hi>Rabbin</hi> put out. To which that would touch, which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Azoare.</hi> 65. <hi>I will ſend you a clear and beautifull fire.</hi> All this which adheres then to the low black part, is therwith conſumed &amp; deſtroyed, and holdeth place of death: after which, cometh true life: the blue flame likewiſe if it therein degenerate, and lets it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate; but the white doth not endeavor but to uncover it ſelf here below to tranſport it ſelf upwards: and not ſuffer it ſelf to bee over maſtered by others. And doth not devoure nor deſtroy, nor is not thereby devoured, nor his clear ſhining ſplendor alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as are thoſe of the others: By reaſon whereof wee muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and let our ſelves be ſalted with this white fire, and bee il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with this fair white light that never varies, following that which is ſaid in the 4. of <hi>Deut. You which adhere to the Lord your God, you are all living alſo, as at this day.</hi> But if our blew light the ſoul, adhere to the black, and to the red, which are our ſenſualities and concupiſcences, the ſtrange fire will force it ſelfe into us, and will devoure and conſume us. This knowledge of the Elements, and of their colours, doth not inſiſt only in compoſed bodies, here below, but thereby wee may mount as by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, the height of this celeſtiall world, where the Elements are alſo, yet of another ſort, more ſimple and depured: and from thence to paſſe beyond into the intelligible world, where they are in their true eſſence; for all conſiſts in the four Elements. Sons of wiſdome underſtand (ſaith <hi>Hermes</hi> in his Tract of 7. chapters) not only corporally, but alſo ſpiritually, the ſcience of the four Elements, whoſe ſecret apparition is in no wiſe ſignified, except they bee firſt compounded, becauſe of the Elements; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made without their compoſition and Regiment. Will we dive more deeply into the ſecrets of this Caball? This Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Regiment of the Elements, is no other thing then the <hi>Sacroſanct.</hi> four-lettered ineffable <hi>Jehovah:</hi> which comprehends all that which is, was, and ſhall bee: where the little and finall ה notes the body and matter, or other the like, where the Fire cleaveth or faſteneth unto: The ך <hi>vau</hi> or cloud copulative which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153427:54"/> aſſembles the two ה the intelligible and the ſenſible, are the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that join the Soul with the Body: the red inflammation of the coal or weik, with the azure flame, doe ſignifie the ſoul: and the Jod is the white unchangeable and permanent flame of the intellect, where all at length comes to terminate, which white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the ſeat of the true ſpirituall hidden light, which is not ſeen nor known, but by it ſelf: for indeed our nature to take it in it ſelf, is but a dark ſubſtance; right reſembling the Moon, which hath no light but what it receives from the Sun, which ſhe is apt to receive, as our ſoul is that of the intellectuall light: And there is not a creature whatſoever, which is of it ſelf a ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all light; but only a participation of the only true light, which ſhineth in all, and through all, plainly and ſenſibly. It is the <hi>Chaſmall</hi> of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> according to <hi>Zohar,</hi> whence proceeds fire or light aſſembled of two, which are yet but one thing: the white light, namely which mounteth and cleareth that, which no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eye could ſuffer, that of which is written in 46. <hi>Pſal. Light is riſen to the juſt, and gladneſſe to the upright in heart:</hi> which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds to the intelligible world, and the inward man. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a twinckling and flaming light, of a red fiery colour, joined and united to a coal, or a weik, ſignifying the ſenſible world, and the outward corporall man. The ſoul is placed in the middle, namely the blew light, part whereof, is faſtened to the weik, and part to the white flame; quickly adhering to one, and quickly to another, whence according as ſhee applies it ſelf it comes to bee either burned or illuminated, following that which <hi>Origen</hi> ſets down upon the 14. of <hi>Jer. That God is a red burning fire, conſuming and deſtroying, as concerning ſinners, and to holy and juſt perſons, a white rejoycing and vivifying light: Jamblicus,</hi> that doth not ſoar ſo high as <hi>Zohar,</hi> being not aſſiſted but by the light and inſtinct of nature, ſaid very well, but afterwards the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> Theologie, that al which we can perceive of goodneſſe and contentment, in this ſenſible world, comes from the light which is imparted to us from the Sun, and Stars illuſtrated with it. And as the Sun imparts his light to the Moon, to the Stars, and to the Heavens: ſo God (communicates his to the intelligible world:) the lively Fountain of all others, to his bleſſed Intelligences. So that, all what our ſouls can have of good, of joy, of beatitude, be it whileſt they are annexed to the bodies, or ſeparated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153427:54"/> comes from this primordiall light, which ſhineth in them by reflexion, as the Sun beams in a baſin, a concave looking glaſſe, or in water, or twhart a looking glaſs, according as St. <hi>Denys</hi> ſets it down, in his 4. chapter of divine names: which proceeding from the Soveraign good, carries therewith the ſame appellation. And <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> in his chapters ſets down, that the heavens were created with the light of the Creators veſtment, grounding himſelf upon the Pſalmiſt, 204.2. <hi>Clad with light as with a veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Earth with ſnow, which was under the throne of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> All Rabinique Allegories, may men ſay, but where doe the great myſteries conſiſt, from which St. <hi>Denys</hi> doth not ſtraddle far in the place alledged? for even as this fair great and clear ſhining Sun, that hath in it ſelf ſuch a manifeſt repreſentation and image of Soveraign good, extends it light throughout the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and doth communicate it to all that are capable to receive it. So that there is nothing, which doth not participate of his light, and vivifying heat: there is nothing, that can hide it ſelf from the heat thereof. In the ſame manner this Eternall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſtiall light, illuſtrates, vivifies, and perfects all that which hath being, and baniſheth darkneſſes and all ſoftning hoarineſſe, that may bee brought thereinto, lightning our ſouls with a deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to participate more and more of this light: for when ſhe comes to prove it by little and little, and by degrees that helps it and conducts to the joy and fruition of a Soveraign good, which is the light of the Soul, namely the Intellect that clears it, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to apprehend the living ſpring from whence it came; for light is not ſeen, but by her ſelf the moſt worthy and excellent property of fire, with which it hath this in particular and proper, that ſhee makes her ſelf to ſee, as it doth, and by her means manifeſteth all that which our ſight may apprehend. Yet there is nothing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to comprehend, then that which is either of the one or of the other, for in ſhewing us, and revealing us all it is then, when ſhee hides her ſelf moſt from us, even to blinde us and to reduce our brightneſſe into darkneſſe; As is his darkneſſe, ſo is his light.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt then not ſpeak of God without light, becauſe he is the crue light becauſe, O Lord, thou art my Lantern: which doth enlighten us, by thy word, <hi>Thy word is a Lantern to my feet,</hi> the ſplendor of the Father, and the living fountain of life: as holy St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> after St. <hi>John. In him was life, and the life
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153427:55"/> was the light of men, and light ſhined in darkneſſe, and the darkneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehended it not.</hi> So that from this light, wee have double com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity: the one, that life, by which wee live, the other the light by which wee ſee, that which enlightens us. The ſpirituall man, the true man enjoyes the one and the other: the Carnall man, life onely: for touching the reſt, <hi>hee is in darkneſſe, becauſe they have been rebells to light,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, becauſe they have not her wayes.</hi> Even as if one ſhould incloſe a to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to mount from fire here below to the Celeſtiall, which is the Sunne, the eye and heart of the ſenſible world, and the viſible Image of the inviſible God. Saint <hi>Denis</hi> cals it an all-apparent and cleare Statue of God; and <hi>Iamblichus</hi> the Image of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, the father of life, the Image and portraict of the Prince, and Soveraigne Dominator of all the univerſe, the light of the one, and the other world, the Celeſtiall and Elementary. But may we not here alledge at once this brave authority of <hi>Plutarch</hi> on the interpretation of the word <hi>El,</hi> where after he had turned it, and returned it about a pot by many diſcourſes, which at laſt concluding nothing, vaniſhed away in ſmoak: he concludes that this word, as indeed it is, would ſay nothing elſe, but thou art? which hath been drawn from the two firſt letters of the holy four lettered word <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> tranſpoſed the one before the other, in the Greek <hi>E.L.</hi> which ſheweth that they have all drunke of this Caballine or Moſaicall fountaine. And at laſt come to ſay, We worſhip God in his eſſence, by our thoughts, and reverence the Sun, which is its Image, for the vertue which it hath given it, to produce things here below: only repreſenting by its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, which he communicates to all, I know not what appearance, or rather ſhadow of beatitude and mercy, ſo much as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a viſible Nature to repreſent an Intelligible, and a moving to that which is immoveable and ſtable. We ſee the Sunne, as wel as fire, but not ſo neare, to be able ſo exactly to marke it, we ſhall very well conjecture in our ſpirit of that which we may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by ſight, that this muſt be the moſt admirable peece of worke of all viſible Creatures. For although it appears unto us little bigger then a diſh or platter, in regard of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt us and it, ſo that I tremble to conceive it, after the very demonſtrations Mathematicall, which are certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, yet it is many times greater then the Globe of the Earth and Water joined together, which containeth more then 6000 miles about, an apparent witneſſe of the wiſdome and greatneſſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153427:56"/> of its Architect. Of which <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> in the 43. chapter makes this fine Epiphonema<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who is he that can ever ſatisfie himſelf to contemplate the glory of the Creator? the Firmament in its height which comprehends all things under it, ſo pure and cleare? and the forme of this vaſt and immenſe hollow of Heaven ſo faire and admirable to the ſight? Is not this an apparent viſion of his glorious and triumphant Majeſty? The Sunne at his riſing ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light of the day (an admirable veſſell) arrived in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his dayly Carreer, it burns and roſteth the earth, and who is it that can ſubſiſt before its extreame heat? It burneth thrice double the mountains, more then the fiery furnaces the pottery which they put to ſcum off, exhaling from it ſelfe flaming vapors, and a ſplendor which darkens the moſt ſtrong aſſured ſight. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord which hath made and formed it of nothing ſo fair, ſo great, and admirable, may well ſay it to be greater then his owne worke, and which haſteth it ſo ſpeedily, as to meaſure this incomprehenſible ſpace in 24 hours. With the ſurplus of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which refers it ſelfe, and is as a Paraphraſe upon the 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where in few termes, there are touched three principall points of the Sunne: Its beauty compared to a ſpouſe comming out of his bed chamber, and he as a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And its extream celerity, his going forth is from the end of the Heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it. So that as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his third Sermon upon Advent, there are three things in the Sunne, its courſe, its ſplendor, and its heat; the heat dries, the ſplendor illuminates, and its courſe runs through the univerſe. And as in man, which is the little world, the heart is the chiefe ſeat of life, firſt living, and laſt dying: So the Sunne in the great man, which is the World, is the ſpring, the light and heat which vivifieth all things which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth to the Starres and to the Moone the light by which they ſhine; even as Chriſt, which is the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, and the light of our Souls, which without it, would remaine bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in a blinde obſcurity. He that followes me ſhall not walke in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life, which conſerves it ſelf for the good, and extinguiſheth it ſelfe againſt the wicked wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 18. <hi>The light of the wicked ſhall be put out.</hi> Where light
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153427:56"/> is ſuch, that ſometimes the evill Angels transform themſelves to deceive us; for in as little as we can blow it backe behinde us, it growes dead and diſſipates. But the true and right light doth il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us without variation as well in the knowledge of God, in this which dependeth on our Salvation, as of things ſenſible and naturall; whereunto the clearneſſe of the Sunne and of Fire, and their effects do guide us more then any other thing, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome ſparkle of this ſoveraigne Wiſdome, wherewith God built this great All by his Word. For every ſcience to which we may attaine by our ratiocination and diſcourſe, proceeds from the knowledge of ſenſible things, (for there is nothing in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, but was firſt in the ſenſe) but incertaine and variable, to be in continuall variation and viciſſitude. So that the knowledge that comes from the light of Nature, is very weake, and full of doubts, and incertitudes, if it bee not illuſtrated by Divine Revelation, which makes us ſee all as it is in its true and reall eſſence, as the light of the Sunne doth all things corporall. So that the moſt part of heathen Philoſophers, after they have alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck't their ſpirit to the perquiſition of naturall cauſes, they finde themſelves ſo confounded, that they are forced to avow that by the only way of ratiocination you cannot draw truth therefrom. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſcourſeth thereupon well at large, in the 4. of the <hi>Metaphyſicks. Ptolomie</hi> alſo, that we muſt not ground and rule our conceptions for regard of corporall things above ſpirituall; for they are farre diſtant each from other, and there is much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity and diſproportion between them.

Behold the relations of theſe Sunnes the ſenſible and intelligible, and of the two lights that proceed therefrom. For as that of the Sunne obtains the firſt place in corporall things, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his book of freewill, and that by means thereof, the inferiour communicate with the ſuperiour, the ſame doth the light of the ſpirituall Sun in regard of intelligibles.</p>
               <p>There are alſo things that have heat, and no light, as that of Animals of quick chalk beſprinkled with water, horſe and pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dung, which <hi>Galen</hi> writes, he hath ſeen to wax a fire of it ſelfe, heapes of oats, and other graines, except Barly, new wines which boil, the lees in the vintage, heaps of Olives, Apples, and Peares, which is a kind of putrefaction, whence alſo there is engendred ſome ſtrange heat, as we ſee in Apoſtemaes, and in fleſh which begins to bee corrupted; and on the contrary wee ſee others that have light and no heat; as worms that gliſter in the night, and of little flies that fly in the dark in ſummer time; of ſhels and ſcales of fiſh, in rotten wood, in ſtones, and in the eyes of ravenous beaſts. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſpeaking of the viſible and inviſible, this ſaid he, cannot wel be expreſſed in words; it is as little flyes which flye in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which by diſplaying their wings, fly into the eyes with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153427:57"/> ſmall ſparkling fires; the worms alſo that ſhine in the night, the ſhels and ſcales of ſome fiſhes, and other the like, which cannot be perceived in the light, but very well in the darke, for the fire which ſo ſhineth from them in the dark, is not a colour, whoſe property is to make it ſeene at the brightneſſe of the Sunne, or other light, becauſe that the air being tranſparent and deprived of all colours, the ſight might very eaſily pierce it, and paſſe through to apprehend them.</p>
               <p>But there are four differences of viſible things, ſome cannot ſee but by day, the others, on the contrary, but by night, others by day and night, and others that have no place in darkneſſe.

Thoſe betwixt both, as the Moon and ſome Stars, by day and by night, as the morning and the evening Stars, called by the Greeks <hi>Phoſphor,</hi> by the Latines <hi>Lucifer,</hi> this is <hi>Venus</hi> Starre. Fire alſo which pierceth the air more then it may, and illuſtrates it to demonſtrate the colours that are therein; for the reſt it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make it ſee, without bringing into action the tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is in the air, as we may ſee in the darke, where wee ſee fire a great way off, but not by the colours that are betwixt them. By day it ſhines alſo, but not act againſt the air, for that it is ſuffocated and extinguiſhed by a ſtronger light. The clearneſſe of the Moone likewiſe, for that ſhee is not very dark, ſhee is ſeen in the day time, but better in the night. <hi>Suidas</hi> runs through all this; But to the purpoſe of lights without heat, I have read of nothing more admirable and ſtrange, then that which <hi>Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo de Oviedo</hi> in the 15. Book 8. chap. of his <hi>Naturall Hiſtory of the Indies,</hi> alledgeth of a certain little flying animal, of the bigneſſe of an Hanneton, very frequent in the Iſle of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in other Iſlands thereabouts, having two wings above, ſtrong and hard, and two below them, two others more thinne and fine. The little
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153427:58"/> beaſt called <hi>Cocuye,</hi> hath ſhining eyes as lighted candles, ſo that whereſoever he paſſes he illuminates the air, and gives it ſuch a brightneſſe that a man may ſee him a great way off, and in a chamber as dark as it may be, even at midnight, men may read and write by the light that comes from them: So that if a man binde two or three together, this would give more light then a Lanthorne or a Torch, in the field: and amidſt the Woods in the night, as darke as may bee, they make themſelves to be ſeen more then a mile. This clearneſſe conſiſts not onely in the eyes but alſo in their flanks, when they open their wings. They are accuſtomed to ſerve themſelves with them, as we do with a Lamp or other light, to ſup at night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to do the affairs of the houſe. But when he comes to determine and dye, its light extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo. The Indians had a cuſtome to make a poſt of them to ſtrike feare in ſeeing them by night, for that it ſeemed that they had a viſage, being rub'd therewith, as if it were all fire. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 21. Book, chap. 11. ſpeaketh of a ſhining herb in the night, called <hi>Nyctegretes</hi> or <hi>Nyctilops</hi> for that we may ſee it ſhine a farre off, but he alledgeth many things by heare-ſay, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen them.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the Suns light which is therein more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then in any other thing ſenſible with heat, for it is the true heavenly fire, as <hi>Speuſippus</hi> ſaid, which deſcribeth all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the nouriſhment of this great man, the Univerſe; as the Elementary doth the viands of the animal man. And as the heart in animals is the principall ſoul of life, the ſame is the Sunne in the heart of the world; and the primordiall ſpring of all light therein, which he departs to the Stars, as doth Jeſus Chriſt to our ſouls. And no more nor leſſe then the Sunne and the Moon (ſaid <hi>Origen</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis</hi>) illightens our bodies; likewiſe our conſciences and thoughts are from this ſplendour of the Father if wee be not blinde, and that this proceeds not by our faults: Now if we be not all equally illuminated, no more then the Stars are by the Sunne, which differ in brightneſſe one from the other but according to our capacity and carriage, and as more or leſſe, we lift up the eyes of our contemplation to receive this light. Returne you towards me, and I will returne towards you, for he is a God at hand, and not a God a farre off. That which we can have of intelligence (ſaith <hi>Zohar</hi>) by our naturall ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153427:58"/> is as if our ſpirit were lightned by the Moone: but the Divine relation holds place of the Sunne, whence the light cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away and baniſheth the Princes of Darkneſſe, where their greateſt force and vigour raignes. The Sunne is riſen, they ſhall be placed in their chambers, ſayes the 104 <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſpeaking of Devils and wicked Spirits, under the name of ſavage and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Beaſts. For (as <hi>Zohar</hi> puts it) theſe tenebrions are ſtronger and more gallant in the darke, ſo the good Angels that aſſiſt and favour us, receive great reinforcement from the light, not onely from the Divine, but from the Celeſtiall and ſolar, by which the Divine and Supreame ſhining brightneſſe, imparts her vertue to the heavens, and by them communicates it to all that is under the ſphere of the Moone within the elementary world.

So that fire is a great aid and comfort to us, not onely during our life, but yet after our death againſt theſe wicked dark powers which gnaw in obſcurity, as theſe night birds and ſavage beaſts which dare not appeare in the day, fearing the light of the Sunne; how much more then that of good ſpirits their adverſaries, which receive it from the divine reſplendence? for the ſame, as is the Sunne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, the fire is in regard of the Sunne, who ſerves us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things to make us ſee this ſo great accompliſhed work of the univerſe built by the Soveraigne Creator of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Artifice, and that which his light doth manifeſt unto us, in this ſenſible world, it is nothing for this regard, for the true being doth conſiſt of things intellectual, ſtript of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity and matter, the Sunne it ſelfe, the rareſt maſter-piece of all others could not ſee it ſelfe, but by its proper light, which is preſently accompanied with a heat vivifying all things; for there is a double propriety, one to ſhine and clarifie, the other to warme, yea to burne the ſubjacent matters which illuminates the whiteneſſe, and waxeth blacke with the Sunnes heat. The <hi>Sunne hath coloured mee, Cant.</hi> 1. Whereupon <hi>Origen</hi> notes, that there where there is no ſinne, nor matter of ſinne, there is ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or burning following, the 121 <hi>Pſalm. The Sun ſhall not burne
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153427:59"/> thee by day, nor the Moon by night;</hi> for the Sunne illuminates good men, but it burnes up ſinners; who hating light for the evill they have done; for in many places of Scripture you ſhall finde that the Sunne and the Fire, whereof it ſpeake, they are not thoſe that wee ſee, but the ſpirituall. The ſpirituall Sunne ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> doth not riſe, but upon holy perſons, following that which is ſpoken of the perverſe, in the 5. of <hi>Wiſdome, The light of Juſtice is not riſen upon us, nor the Sunne of Intelligence is not come to illighten us.</hi> As for its heat, it muſt rather be kept for witneſſe of Holy Scripture, there is no man can hide him from the heat thereof; not to frivolous imaginations and ſubtilities of thoſe that maintaine it to be neither hot nor cold, grounding themſelves upon this argument, All heat in long continuance although that it remaine alwayes in the ſame eſtate and degree, doth notwithſtanding augment it ſelfe, ſo that it would bee intolerable.</p>
               <p>If then the Sunne be ſo hot, as it ſeems, after five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſince when it was firſt created, it would follow that there would come a conflagration under the torrid <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And afterwards for that the ſunne is many times greater then the globe of the Sea, and the Earth, and its Sphere, ſo farre eſloigned from it, that it hath no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, it ſhould follow, that it was as hot in one time and place, as in another. With ſemblable deductions, againſt which it is eaſie to contradict, but this would turne us aſide too farre from our principall Subject. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> alſo ſaid, that it was a groſſe enflamed ſtone, or a plate of burning fire. <hi>Anaximander,</hi> a wheel full of fire, 25. times greater then all the earth. <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> an heap of little fires. The Stoicks, an inflamed body, proceeding from the Sea, wherein they have ſhewed the affinity of fire and ſalt together. <hi>Plato</hi> a body of much fire; and thus, one after one faſhion, one after another, but all tending to make it of the nature of fire. Moreover, it is a thing too admirable, of its greatneſſe, ſo immenſe, whereupon the ſpirit of man hath fair Galleries to walke, in purſuit of the high fetched meditations of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; for (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid well upon <hi>Geneſis</hi>) we muſt from the contemplation of the creatures, aſcend and come to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153427:59"/> So that thoſe then, are very ignorant and void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who cannot from the Creatures, attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creator. Thoſe that dwell in the extremities of the Weſt, where it goes as it were to bed, in the waters of the Ocean, ſee it at his riſing of the ſame grandeur, as thoſe of <hi>Catai,</hi> where it riſeth; which ſheweth the ſmallneſſe and diſproportion of the earth in compariſon thereof. That if the Moone, which is farre inferior in greatneſſe thereunto, ſheweth it ſelfe almoſt equall, it is by reaſon of the great diſtance from the one and the other, for by ſo much as things are at a diſtance, by ſo much the more they leſſen themſelves to our ſight, and this is ſufficiently verified by the rules of perſpective. Surely theſe are two chiefe Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, that of theſe two great luminaries, which are not of ſmall ornament and commodity, for the life of man, as Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> puts it, upon the 135. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> but it doth contribute much thereto, yea almoſt all, in regard of that which concernes the body; for beſides the light wherewith they enlighten us by day and by night, they diſtinguiſh times and ſeaſons, help us to make voyages, as well by Sea, as Land, they ripen fruits, without which our corporall life could not be maintained, with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite uſages which proceed from them. The Sunne is put for the whole Heaven, for that it is the greater part thereof, and for fire; and Heaven is the ſeat and veſſell of incorruptible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable bodies. The Moone preſident of moiſture, repreſents water and earth, and ſalt compoſed thereof; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein moiſture is more permanent, nor which is more moiſt then ſalt, whereof the Sea for the moſt part doth conſiſt; and there is nothing where the Moone doth more diſtinctly make her motions to appeare, then in the Sea, as we perceive in the ebbing and flowing thereof, and in the braines and marrows of Animals, ſo that for good cauſe ſhe is called the Regent of the waters, and of phlegmatick and wateriſh moiſture; which although it ſeem to be dead and inanimate, (in reſpect of fire which is living) ſhe is permanent chiefly in ſalt, which hath an inexterminable humidity; and is that which keepeth the Sea from drying up, for without Salt it had been long agone drawn out and dryed up, there where the fire lives not in it, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for in that it is a materiall Element, it hath no place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it. Of theſe two, namely, the heat of the Sun, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153427:60"/> of the Moone, in which conſiſteth the life of all things; and without which nothing would grow, increaſe, nor be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, not fire it ſelfe, which cannot ſubſiſt without air, which is double, one participating of the heat of fire, aſcending from the water (out of the bowels of moiſt nature, a ſincere and light fire forthwith flying out, ſeeks things aloft, ſaith <hi>Triſmegiſtus.</hi>) And the other as water deſcending from fire, ſo long till it come to congeal. For ſo there is one moiſt water which tends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to rarifie it ſelfe in the aire, and another cold comming downe to thicken it ſelfe in the nature of Earth, untill at laſt it comes to terminate in red fire, which is in gold, for gold is the laſt ſubſtance of all. And Aire is the mediating conciliator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the moiſture of paſſable water, that conſtitutes matter and the fires heat, on which the Agent and form doth depend: Earth is as the matrix where fire, by the means of air and fire introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing its action, excites, and thruſts out, which is thereby engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to its determined end. The other five Planets, and the fixed ſtarres come in but collaterally, as aſſiſtants and coadjutors of the effects of the two luminaries, where all their influxions are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as do the rivers of the Sea, and from the earth reciprocally comes back their norriture; ſo that heaven and fire, are as the male, the agent, and water and earth, as the female, patient; but under heaven, the air is comprized.

               <p>We hold well for the remainder, that all we have from light in the ſenſible world, comes from the Sun, for that of the Moon, and of the Stars although inumerable, is a very ſmall thing; yet it proceeds from the Sun; and that of fire, is but artificiall to give us light for default of the Sunne, But how ſhall it ſquare with that to be willing to attribute the primitive ſource of light, and chiefly that of the producing and vivifying to the ſunne, for that we ſee in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the firſt thing that was made, was the light on the firſt day, and the Sunne not till the fourth, vegetables being produc't from the former? This was (ſay the <hi>Rabbins</hi> thereto) moſt wiſely adviſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as all his other writings proceeding from divine inſpiration, to take away from men all occaſion to Idolize this luminary, when we ſee that light was procreated before it. But in this reſpect there preſents a very rare myſtery, and worthy of obſervation, that the compleat perfection of things fals out alwaies on the fourth day, as of the light. The Sunne and Moone were made the fourth day, waters on the ſecond day, produced nought but fiſhes; the fifth, which is the fourth after, and al animals; the ſixth with man, for whom the fruits of the earth were made the third.

               <p>Behold that which we here thought to runne through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe three fires, (as for the three ſalts which relate thereunto, we will ſpeak thereof hereafter) namely, the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall and Elementary, the Heavenly and Solary, and the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, that of the Divine Eſſence denoting the Father, from whence proceeds the light which is the Sunne, and theſe two the heat of the Holy Spirit, which kindles our hearts with the love and knowledge of God, and with charitable love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>The ſame in heaven, the light of the Sunne expands it ſelfe to illighten all the ſtarres, and here below to the production and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153427:62"/> vivification of all that which is there begotten, and maintained. And in the Elementary world, fire doth clear us, warm us, and boil our viands, and lends us all other commodities, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
               <p>As for fire in the 66. of <hi>Eſay</hi> 15, 16. which the Evangeliſt cites here, whoſe fire ſhall not extinguiſh, and whoſe worme dieth not. It is without doubt deſtinated to the puniſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, which ſhall never be quenched, nor the worme that ſtingeth the conſcience ſhall never dye; To keep that this worm that is engendred of corruption may not procreate, we muſt ſalt it with diſcretion and prudence, that it may do nothing which may offend and ſcandalize his neighbour, according as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſpecifies it, <hi>Hee that ſhall ſcandalize one of theſe little ones that beleeve in mee.</hi> And as for baniſhing and chaſing away ſtrange fire, that devours our ſoul, as a burning feaver doth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall heat, this muſt be done by the mediating intervention of divine fire, which is much more puiſſant then any other. Let us heare that which to this purpoſe Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alledgeth in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Offices, Saint <hi>John</hi> baptized Jeſus Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, which is the type and image of the Holy Ghoſt, who after his aſcenſion, muſt deſcend for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, ſo enflaming as a fire doth the ſoul and heart of the faithfull, according as <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſaith in 20. &amp; 9. after he had received the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and it was as a burning fire in my heart, ſhut up in my bones.</hi> What is the meaning then of that in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that the fire was become water, and this water excites the fire, but that the ſpirituall grace burneth by the fire, and by the water it doth purifie and cleanſe our ſinnes? for ſinne waſheth and burneth, according to which the Apoſtle ſaith, fire will prove what each mans works ſhall bee; for it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be, that this examination ſhould bee perfected in all thoſe that deſire to returne into Paradiſe. It was not without cauſe, nor idlely ſet downe in the 3. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that after <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were baniſhed from thence, he placed at its entrance a bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing ſword of fire, to keep the paſſage to the tree of life. With this fire then we muſt all be ſalted that are in the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; following that which <hi>Origen</hi> ſets downe in his 3. <hi>Homil.</hi> upon the 36. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> Wee muſt all goe to the fire of Purgatory, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but all ſhall not paſſe thereby, after the ſame
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153427:62"/> ſort as they did, whereof it is ſaid in the 43. of <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. <hi>When thou ſhalt paſſe through the waters, the waves ſhall not cover thee, for I will be with thee, when thou ſhalt march through the fire, thou ſhalt not bee burnt.</hi> The Iſraelites paſſed through the red Sea dry-ſhod, and the Aegyptians were drowned therein: The three children in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> furnace, had no detriment, and thoſe that heated the fire without, were therewith conſumed. And in the 19. <hi>Hom.</hi> upon the 16. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> All are not purged by this fire that parts from the Altar, it is the fire of the Lord; for hee that is from the Altar, is not of God, but a ſtrange fire, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the cruciating of ſinners, which ſhall never be quenched, nor the worm that gnaweth ſhall never dye: for after that the ſoul by a multitude of its wicked comportments hath heaped up within him abundance of ſinnes, this congregation of evils in ſucceſſion of times, comes to boil and enflame us with a paine and puniſhment internall, as the body doth of a feaver procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the exceſſe of the mouth, or other ſuperfluities, when ſhe ſhall come to thinke and relate a hiſtory of its delinquencies, which will bee a perpetuall prickle, wherewith it will bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, ſo that ſhee will make her ſelfe as an accuſer and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt her ſelfe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Otherwiſe how is it that naturall heat could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153427:64"/> work thereupon, which is much weaker then that of fire? wee know by experience that we could not draw any nouriſhment from ſtones, metals, earth, and other ſubſtances, whereupon fire cannot bite: and if wolves doe ſometimes eat clay, wild-ducks, and other birds, ſmall flints, and gravell, it is either to avoid vacuity, or for ſome medicament to them knowne by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtinct of nature, but not that this doth digeſt or ſerve them for maintenance, no more then Iron doth <hi>Oſtriches;</hi> which yet they corrupt by a ſtrong and great heat of their ſtomach. But you will ſay, that this aſſimilation contraries the text of the 10. of <hi>Leviticus</hi> where <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes are ſo burned for offering ſtrange fire.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Rabbi Simeon</hi> to <hi>Zohar</hi> relates in part, that they ſerved at the Altar, being drunk, and overcome with wine, for that which followes after demonſtrates it; that God ſaid unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> Thou nor thy ſonnes ſhall not drink wine when you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Tabernacle: whereto may be anſwered, that ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes cannot in all, or through all agree, otherwiſe it would be the ſame thing they repreſent. <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> doth not make drunke if men take not ſo much at a time, that it may alienate people from their ſpirit. And yet being ſeparate from wine, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhould be nothing but phlegme, and reſidences, which cannot in any ſort make drunke, nor being therewith mingled and adjoined by nature, as to ſtoppe again the acuity of the <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> Yet we ſee by experience, in Germany and other cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, where <hi>aqua vitae</hi> is in good eſteem, as well for the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they take; it doth not for that make men drunke, as wine would do in ſuch a quantity, as that, wherewith it ſhould be quenched; and putting a little Salt in very ſtrong wine, it will make men drunk ſooner then to drinke it pure. I have often made tryall, that often joyning together <hi>aqua vitae</hi> to that which men had drawne, this mingling could not cauſe drunkenneſſe any more, becauſe the parts once ſeparated of the compounded elements, and then reconjoined, take another nature then it had at the firſt.

And in this caſe there is a fair conſideration to bee marked, that God left to <hi>Adam</hi> the nomination of terreſtriall things: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelfe that of Celeſtiall: as hee expreſſeth in the 115. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>The Heaven of Heavens are the Lords, but the Earth hath he given to the children of men:</hi> which is as much to ſay, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Rabbi</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> in the 2.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153427:66"/> they goe to looſe themſelves in Heaven: ſo that all which is here under the ſphere of the Moon, and generally all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, they call it Heaven: and the Heaven of Heavens, the Aethereall Region from the Moon to the Firmament, as well the Firmament it ſelf, or the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Heaven. But farther that the Stars ſhould bee all of one nature, propriety and effect, to ſee them ſo like, beſides their greatneſſe and clearneſſe, it follows not that the ſame appears of the ſame ſort as of fire, yet wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call them fires and celeſtiall lights: It is as if the ſeeds of trees and plants, whereof there are infinite, ſhould all mixe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the firſt buds alſo, that they caſt, which differ as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to the meaſure whereunto they grow, their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe manifeſt them.

Such is the <hi>aqua vitae</hi> drawn from wine, the moſt comfortable and connaturall ſubſtance of all others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not abuſed with exceſſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the 3.

If you give fire (he ſets it down there) which is of a mediocrity to the clay, and earth to the Potter, he will conſolidate it in the pots, bricks, tiles, and other the like works, but if it be exceſſive, hee reſolves it, and makes it melt and run.

               <p>But ſtrong waters, which diſſipate and ruine all, are this ſtrange fire, and ſo Alchymiſts call them, and fire againſt nature externall fire, and other the like exterminatives. Certes if the effects of Cannon Powder be ſo admirable, conſiſting of ſo few ſpecies, and ingredients, which may be well called the true infernall fire, the devourer of mankind. The action of ſtrong waters is no leſſe which burne all, being compounded onely of two or three ſubſtances, that which wee commonly call the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, Salt-peter, Vitriol,</hi> or Allum Ice, and this diſſolves Silver, Copper, Quickſilver, and Iron in part. <hi>La Regalle</hi> which is no other thing then the prec ding rectified upon <hi>Salarmoniac,</hi> or common Salt, diſſolved partly with Iron, Lead, Tinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable Gold, with all ſorts of fire. It is true, that ſtrong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe not deſtroy metals, that they returne not to their firſt forme and nature, but drawes them to water, and a melting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. This was certainly a good Artificiall induſtry in mans ſpirit, to excogitate ſo ſhort a way to ſeparate Gold and Silver melted together, and ſo uniformedly mixed, that an ounce of Gold melted with an hundred markes of Silver, each part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will equally attract his portion, as wee may ſee by the refiners practiſe, which to prove that which it holds of Gold &amp; of Silver, a confuſed maſſe of divers metals will take but 30. grains to make their eſſay in the Coupelle, and from thence will judge that the ſame proportion that you ſhall finde in this ſmall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, ſhall bee alſo in the whole maſſe; all that which may bee therein of impure imperfect metall goes away partly in ſmoake, and is partly conſumed by fire, and partly ſticks like Birdlime within the Coupelle, nothing remaining above it but what is fine, namely Silver and Gold, which is there incloſed, with which they ſeparate ſtrong waters called on the occaſion the <hi>divider,</hi> which diſſolves Silver into water, and Gold falls to the bottome as ſand; the water afterwards evaporated, the Silver retires it ſelfe.

               <p>Yet theſe two fires may be compared, namely the ſtrange fire
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153427:68"/> to Leaven, to the Sea water which is ſalt, and to Vinegar, a corrupted Wine, and other ſorts of Leavens Fires againſt nature. And the Celeſtiall to the Altar to pure and unleavened Paſt, to ſweet water fit to drinke, to <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> without Vinegar, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the ſtate of innocence in our firſt fathers, before their tranſgreſſion, and the ſimplicitie of their knowledge, infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Creator. But when they were once tempted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with ambition, to know more then they ſhould, they would by humane diſcourſe become more ſubtill and ſage, in taſting the fruit of knowledge of good and evill; their Paſt without Leaven began to ſwell, to bee proud with the Leaven themſelves introduced, which perverted and ſpoyled it, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating it to corporall and ſenſible things, for the bread which wee eate is leavened, but that which wee uſe in the Church muſt not be ſo, and not without cauſe, for unleavened bread will bee kept ſix moneths without molding or corrupting; that leavened bread will not keep ſo many weekes. It is therefore that the Apoſtle ſaid, a little Leaven corrupts the whole Maſſe: Becauſe that one propriety of the Leaven is to convert into their corruption all that is adjoyning of their nature, as Vinegar doth Wine, and Leaven pure Paſt, alſo Rennet which is in the number of Leavens. And when they have no Leaven, they make ſome, corrupting the Paſt with Vinegar, Lees of Beere, Egges, and like ſubſtances, who by their corruption acquire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the propertie of ſtrange fire which is able to convert into its nature, that where it can bite, as wee may ſee in a Feaver againſt naturall heate, ſo that hee turnes it ſelfe into all things, and all into it ſelfe, according to <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who ſet it downe for the Principall, yet after <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> who thought all things were begotten of Fire after it was extinguiſhed, for being living it begets nothing, no more doth Salt, nor the Sea which <hi>Homer</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

The Chymicks call it the interior fire, fire within the veſſell, for wee ſee by experience, that bread, if the Paſt be not leavened, what boyling ſoever you give it, ſhall never be but of a hard and uneaſy digeſtion, greatly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſtomach, if the Leaven which they joyne thereunto make it boyle within; whence then it comes that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo knowing a man, and ſo illuſtrated with the Divine Spirit, ſo rejecteth a thing ſo profitable and neceſſary, and baniſheth ſo expreſly the Leaven of the Sacrifices, which is ſo great an aide and ſuccour in our principall aliment, Bread. <hi>You ſhall burne no Leaven nor Honey in the Lords Sacrifice, Levit.</hi> 2.11.

Moreover Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters imploy alſo in their Sacrifices Salt and Incenſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things that are not forbidden. It muſt then bee that ſome myſtery lies hidden hereunder. <hi>Origen</hi> in his 5. <hi>Homil.</hi> upon <hi>Levit.</hi> interpreteth Leaven for arrogance, that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a vaine worldly doctrine, which blowes us up as leaven doth Paſt, and makes us proud, thinking that wee know more then wee doe. So that wee quit the expreſſe and direct Word of God, to retaine our ſelves within our phantaſtique traditions, as our Saviour reproacheth it to the Phariſees, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. Truely <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecied very well of you Hypocrites, when hee ſaith, <hi>This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me, howbeit in vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, Mark.</hi> 7.6, 7.

The firſt hath been touched heretofore for pride, and naughtineſſe, that corrupts the ſoule. Touching the good, in the 7. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 12, 13. there are loaves of leavened bread, which they offer for peace offerings, with oblation of thankſgiving, and in the 23. 17. of every family two loaves of the firſt eares of wheat at Pentecoſt; and in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the 23 of St. <hi>Luke</hi> Jeſus Chriſt compared the Kingdome of God to leaven that a woman had put into three meaſures of dough, till it was all lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened; for there it is taken for the fervent zeale of ardent faith; and it is the fire wherewith we muſt be ſalted: for as the fire boyles our meats, and the ſalt ſeaſons them, alſo leaven is the cauſe that the paſt bakes the better, and prepares thereby to make more wholeſome, and of lighter digeſtion, more ſavoury, and of better taſt.

By reaſon whereof the Apoſtle admoniſheth us, to caſt it farre from us: that is to ſay, all ſuperſtition, and malice; <hi>Caſt off the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened, for even
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153427:70"/> Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for you.</hi> Therefore let us keep the Feaſt not with old leaven, neither with the <hi>leaven of malice and wickedneſſe,</hi> but with the <hi>unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> which leaven is without doubt this ſtrange fire, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures and conſumes us within; that is to ſay, our ſoul, to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up, and make us goe downe living into Hell. And the Fire of the Altar, the celeſtiall fire of charity, faith, hope, it is that which we muſt deſire of God to kindle in our hearts, and to ſeaſon our thoughts and our deſires, that no corruption be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten there; as it doth here below in things corruptible and corporall; the prompt Miniſter, and executor of that, which the divine goodneſſe will pleaſe to give of comforts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in this temporall life. What obligations then do wee owe thee, thou excellent portion of Nature, without which we ſhould live in ſo great miſery? thou doeſt lighten in darkneſſe, thou doſt make us rejoyce in obſcurity, bringing us another day.

And for that repentance for ſinne ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede auricular confeſſion, which repentance is denoted by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of ſalt, they bleſſe it alſo before water: It is alſo taken for wiſedome, <hi>You are the ſalt of the earth,</hi> and <hi>have ſalt in your ſelves.</hi> And becauſe that in all their ancient Sacrifices they uſed ſalt, from thence it came that in Baptiſme they put ſalt in the mouth of the Creature before it is baptized with water, for that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet actually have the myſtery of ſalt applyed for the preſent.</p>
               <p>On fire then and on ſalt depend great and ſecret myſteries, comprized under two principal colours, red and white, for (as <hi>Zohar</hi> hath it) all things are white, and red, but there is a great ſpace betwixt the one and the other. God dieth our ſinnes which are red, for concupiſcence comes from the blood, and from the ſenſualitie of the fleſh beſprinkled with blood, and we doe die his whiteneſſe in red or rigour of Juſtice, by the fire which inflameth our carnall deſires, and purchaſeth their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is throughout where there is fire, if it bee not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſaving water. And when the perverſe doe prevaile in the world, as ordinarily they doe, redneſſe and judgement extend themſelves therein, and all whiteneſſe covers it ſelf, which is rather changed into redneſſe then redneſſe into whiteneſſe; which if it have domination, all on the contrary growes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent therewith. To theſe two colours alſo the ancient and the Evangelicall Law, the rigour of juſtice and mercy; the pillar of fire in the nights darkeneſſe, and the white cloud by day, wine and bread, blood and fat, which were not lawfull to eate. <hi>You ſhall not eate fleſh with the blood, Gen.</hi> 9.4. And in <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>All the fat is the Lords, it ſhall bee a perpetuall Statute for your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions throughout all your dwellings, that yee eate neither fat nor blood;</hi> where it is yet more particularly repeated in the 17. and 14. where the reaſon is rendred, for that <hi>the ſoule,</hi> that is to ſay, the life of the fleſh, is in <hi>the blood,</hi> which myſtically repreſents that of Meſſiah, wherein conſiſted eternall life, ſo that it was not lawfull to uſe any other before his comming. Of the ſame fat was reſerved for God as well that which the Hebrewes call <hi>cheleb,</hi> that covereth the inwards, and is ſeparated from the fleſh, as the other called <hi>ſchumen,</hi> which is thereunto annexed; but metaphorically the fat is taken for the moſt exquiſite ſubſtance,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153427:73"/> as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. the tenths the beſt of the fruits are called the fat of them, which manner of ſpeech wee alſo life when wee ſay, make the portion to be very fat of any thing that there is. And in the 81. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Hee fed them with the fat of Wheate.</hi> It may bee alſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> well knowing that theſe two ſubſtances, blood and fat, are of ill taſt and nouriſhment, and quickly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted out of their veſſells, hee forebad them the uſe thereof. Or if wee would enter into a certaine myſtery, for that the vitall ſpirits conſiſt in the blood, which are of a fiery nature, and that fat is very ſuſceptible of flame, and proper to make lights, which are a repreſentation of the ſoule. But Oile is alſo for Lamps, which was not forbidden to bee eaten, and wee doe not ſee that in Divine ſervice wee uſe Tallow Candles; yet theſe two, fire and ſalt, doe ſignifie Wine and Milke, <hi>I have drunke Wine with my Milke, Cant.</hi> 5.1. By Wine is deſigned the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill, namely vaine curioſities of worldly things, and by Milke, that of life, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was deprived, being deſirous to taſt of that other, which was humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Before <hi>Adam</hi> had tranſgreſſed (ſaid <hi>Zohar</hi>) hee was made participant of the ſapience of ſuperiour light, being not yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the tree of life, but when hee would diſtract him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe after the knowledge of baſe things, this curioſitie ceaſed not till hee had wholly caſt off life to incorporate himſelfe to death. <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the two principall Potentates on earth which are deſcended therefrom, Item the Roſe and the Lilly, whoſe water extracted mounts by the fires heat that elevates it and becomes white, although the Roſes bee red, as is the fume exhaled from blood and fat which they burne to God, to ſend it on high as a vapour, to imply (ſaith the ſame <hi>Zohar</hi>) that wee muſt offer him nothing but what is cleane and candid; for red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe repreſents ſinne, and puniſhment that followes it; and the white, ſinceritie, with mercy and the finall recompence that doth accompany it. What is it (ſaith <hi>Zohar</hi>) which is deſigned by the red Roſes, and the white Lillies? It is the odour of the oblation proceeding from red blood, and from fat which is white, which God reſerveth for his owne portion, which fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe relates to the ſacrifice, or animall man, who is nouriſhed with this fat, as the vitall ſpirits with blood; wherefore it is ſaid, when we faſt to extenuate and macerate the pricks of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153427:73"/> fleſh and concupiſcence, that we offer unto God fatneſſe, who will have from his Creature the ſoul, which is fire and bloud; and the body, namely fat, wherewith it is nouriſhed, but the one and the other incontaminate, pure and neat without corruption, as if they were to paſſe through the fire and ſalted; Therefore he would that they ſhould be burned to him, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in a white fume and an odour of ſuavity before him; for fume is more ſpiritual then matter, which the fire by ſubtiliation raiſeth it, after the manner of Incenſe. And indeed all this world here, is but an odour that mounts unto God, ſometimes good and agreeable, ſometimes wicked and hurtfull. The forme of the thing which conſiſteth in its colour, and figure, remains incorporeall in the matter, where the eye goes to apprehend it, and aſſociates with it. The taſt alſo, remains attached to it, as the ſpittle moiſtens it, and communicates it to the taſt: But odor or ſmell, ſeparates them, and comes from farre by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable vapor, to the ſenſe of the noſe and braine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture doth particularize in the roſe and in the lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Red and White; whoſe ſmell doth not vaniſh. And yet though the roſes be red, yet the water of them diſtilled, and the fume if you burne them, are white, as thoſe of incenſe, whereof it is ſpoken in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.2. <hi>Let my prayer he directed as incenſe, in thy ſight:</hi> by prayers are underſtood not only prayers, but all our deſires, thoughts and comportmens, and thereupon <hi>Rabbi Eliezer,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi> the author of <hi>Zohar,</hi> making his prayer, doth thus paraphraſe. <hi>This is well knowne, and manifeſt before thee O Lord my God, God of our prayers, that I have offered unto thee my fat, and my blood: I have offered them in an odor of Suavity, with firme faith and beleefe, macerating, chaſtiſing the ſenſuality of my fleſh: That it will pleaſe thee then Lord, that the odor of my prayer, proceeding from my mouth, may be preſently addreſſed before thy face, as an odor of a burnt offering, which they burne unto thee, upon the altar of propitiation, and that thou wilt accept it as agreeable.</hi> He ſaid that becauſe that after the comming of our Saviour, &amp; the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſacrifices were converted into prayers, the bloudy ſacrifices ſignified by the red roſes, and colour of bloud, and thoſe without bloud, as the minchad &amp; other the like, of meal, by the white lillies, following that which was ſaid <hi>Cant. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, he feedeth among the lillies.</hi>

               <p>Under theſe four colours furthermore, which ſignifie the four Elements, Black the Earth, White the Water, Blew the Air, and Red the fire, are compriſed the greateſt ſecrets &amp; myſteries. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reading in ch. 10. of 35 book <hi>Plinie,</hi> that <hi>Apelles</hi> had painted <hi>Alexander</hi> holding lightning in his hand; fingers ſeemed to hang out, and lightning to be without the Table; but reading they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that all thoſe conſiſted of four colours. I cannot well ſpecifie what thoſe four colours were, which muſt be principall in nature, till I had learned out of <hi>Zohar,</hi> to conſider them in the light: where, that is to be noted, that there are two faſtned to the week, namely black, noting the Earth, and red proceeding there from fire; and two to the flame, Blew in the root, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the black, and white on the top, oppoſite to red. But let us ſee how this doth well ſuit with Chymicall Theorie, which conſtitutes of theſe four Elements, two ſolid and fix'd, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves together, the earth, and the fire, which adhere to the week, and the other two liquid volatills and flitting, water, and air, white and blew, as is the flame which is liquid, and in perpetuall motion: And we muſt not think it ſtrange, that the air, the blew, ſhould be lower then the water, or the white flame which is aloft, becauſe the aereall party which is the oil and fat, ſeparate more hardly, and more difficultly from the compoſed, then doth the water more oppoſite to fire. But let us look more myſtically thereinto, which the <hi>Zohar</hi> hath more abundantly run through. The red light, as well in earth as in heaven, is that which deſtroyes all, diſſipates all; for it is the bark of the tree of death, as we may ſee in a lamp, candle, and other light, whoſe root is in the earth, namely, this corruptible and corrupting blackneſſe which watereth the week; the branches and the boughes are the flames, blew and white. The week with its black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and redneſſe is the Elementary world, and the flame the Celeſtiall. The red colour commands all that is under it, and devoureth it. And if you ſay that it domineers alſo in heaven, not as in the inferiour world, wee may anſwer. And although there be vertues and powers above that are deſtructive, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate all baſe ſubjacent things. All theſe ſuperiors are anchored in this red light, and not the inferiors, for they are thick, groſſe, and obſcure; and this red light which is contiguous to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, gnawes, and devours them; and there ia nothing in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153427:74"/> low world which ſhall not be deſtroyed. It penetrates and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into ſtones, it pierceth them, and hollowes them, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may paſſe over them, and drowns all in the depths and hollowes of the earth, where they divide themſelves, of the one ſide, and on the other, till they come to reſemble anew in their <hi>Abyſſus,</hi> paſſing croſſe the darkneſſes that are confounded with them; which is the cauſe that waters riſe and fall, (they mount when they come from the ſea under earth to their ſources, to glide anew above the earth downwards, returning to the place from which they parted.) So that the waters darkneſſe and light mingling themſelves pellmell, there is made within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chaos,</hi> which nature comes to unmingle (the heat namely which is therein incloſed) by Ordinance of the Soveraign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſator that commands it. And there make lights which men cannot ſee, becauſe they are dark. Every channell (to be brief) mounts upwards with his voices, whence <hi>Abyſſus</hi> are ſhaken, and cry to their companion, One depth calleth to another, in the voice of their Catarracts. And who is it that cries? Open thee with thy waters, and I will enter into thee. Theſe are all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries uneaſy to comprehend, which intend nothing, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the affinity and connexion of the ſenſible with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible world, and of the Elementary with the Celeſtiall; for, as it is ſaid in another caſe, the Univerſall firmament, called the firmament of heaven, containeth things ſuperiour and inferiour; although after divers manners. This is wel ſeen in a torch, where blackneſſe, that is, the Earth, is the ground of three elements and colours, the red being but an inflammation and heat joined to the blackneſſe, without any flame or light; as are the blew and white, which proceed from one very root, all tend a going to unite with the white flame that is above, and more highly eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then others. Yet it is not therefore ſo pure and quit of all filthineſſe, but that it procreates ſoot, with black and infected fume, whereof it muſt be depured by fire, till it hath perfected the conſumption of its corruption, and made it a perfect white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which from that time forwards never alters. And this is that which we ſaid before, that fire leaves two ſorts of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not ſufficiently depured for the firſt proof. Aſhes below, whence by the ſame fire is extracted an incorruptible ſubſtance of ſalt; and of glaſſe at the laſt, which the <hi>Zohar</hi> was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153427:75"/> of, when he ſaid upon <hi>Exod.</hi> of the lees of any confected a ſhes, ſalt and glaſſe is drawn. But now for that it was not ſo ſaid, it is a thing ſufficiently common and manifeſt to thoſe that deal with fire, which Cinerall excrement comes from the aduſtion and burning of coals: but the foot which is more ſpirituall, for that mounts and elevates higher, is born of the flame which hath no leaſure or power to perfect its mundification, ſo that the pure and impure mount together. And aſſuredly nothing can better agree with our ſouls after their ſeparation from the body, which carries away with them the imapurities which they have attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from it, during their reſidence here below, which they muſt repaſs by fire, &amp; be perfected by white throughout. <hi>Every man ſhal be ſalted with fire, and every ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt.</hi> The weik and aſhes repreſenting man, the exterior animal, and his body, and the two flames, blew, and white; the blew the Celeſtiall and Ethereall body, and the white, ſouls ſtript of all Corporeity: which in good men ſhall be burnt with fire that burns alwaies upon the altar, and ſalted with ſalt from the Covenant, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes namely of his Meſſiah, into which the Prince of this world, hath but ſeen, as it hath done in the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is al filled with aſhes whereof it was firſt built, &amp; with the ſoot of originall ſin, whereunto he faſtned by his diſobedience, prevarication: So that we are the night where <hi>Moſes</hi> began to reckon the day, for that we are according to the fleſh, before the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who being come after, is the enlightned day of this clear ſun of Juſtice, which the Cabballiſts ſay is the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whoſe ſheath (as they call it) is <hi>Adonei,</hi> from whence God muſt be drawn out: for it is hee, that mundifies the righteous, and burneth the wicked with dark and obſcure fire. To which that alſo beateth, which is ſaid of the Thrones Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls, there ſhall deſcend a Lion enflamed, that ſhall devour the oblations. There are Angells committed upon every member that ſinneth, of whom they conſtitute themſelves the bringers on: for every man that commits any offence, he ſuddainly dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to himſelf an accuſer, which will be no more favourable to him then he muſt be, but will lend him a fire from above, to burn that member that ſhall have treſpaſſed.

By reaſon whereof, the gathering certain <hi>pieds</hi> of herbs all entire with their leaves and rootes, and ſeeds, they burned them, and ſacrificed the odour and fume that proceeded therefrom to the Immortall Gods: and of this exhalation they caſt, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

And certes it is a thing very admirable, the great quantity that there is of ſalt; ſith that we hold it for an infallible maxime, that God &amp; Nature made nothing in vain. For beſides that there is found thereof in the earth, part in liquor which they ſcum off, part in yee, as at <hi>Halle</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and at <hi>Borre</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> part in hard rocks, as in <hi>Teplaga</hi> a land of Negroes, where they carry it more then two hundred miles off upon their heads, and tranſport from hand to hand by relayes, even to the Kingdome of <hi>Tombur,</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for money that paſſeth for currant in all thoſe quarters, as it doth alſo in the Province of <hi>Caindu</hi> in Eaſt Tartarie.

               <p>I have many times made triall very exactly, that of Sea-water, men make or draw more then halfe of ſalt, cauſing the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is therein, ſweetly to evaporate away; what an enormous quantity then would there remaine of ſalt, if the freſh ſubſtance of the Sea were there from extracted? There are no ſands or deſerts, of what long extenditure ſoever, that can compare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, not by the 2. thouſand part; for many men would equall, yea preferre the Sea in quantity and greatneſſe unto the earth. We muſt not here dwell long on particularities that concerne ſalt. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 35. Book <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. The greateſt part depending upon nothing but heareſay, for all tend to no other thing, but in the firſt place to ſhew that there are two ſorts of ſalt (as tis true) Naturall, and Artificiall. The Naturall growes in flakes, or in a rock by it ſelfe, within the earth, as is aforeſaid: the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall is made with ſea-water, or with liquor, as a pickle drawne out of ſalt pits, as they doe in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> County of <hi>Burgundie:</hi> which they boyle and congeale upon the fire. He there ſheweth many examples, and indeed thoſe which are more difficult to beleeve: let the faith be on the ſayers part, and among others of a certaine lake of <hi>Tarentin</hi> in <hi>Poville,</hi> not deeper then the height of knees where water in ſummer time by the Suns heat is all converted into ſalt. And in the Province of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there growes a liquid <hi>Bitumem,</hi> a little thick, which they uſe in Lamps in ſtead of oile. This inflamable ſubſtance being ſtripped therefrom, there remaines ſalt, there under hidden: as indeed wee ſee it by experience that out of every thing that burns there may be ſalt extracted, but there doth not appear any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but wateriſhneſſe and inflamable unctuoſity which muſt be taken away by fire, this done ſalt remains in the aſhes. And this ſalt (ſaith <hi>Geber</hi>) in his teſtament retaines alwayes the nature and property of the thing from which it is extracted, if this be done in a cloſe veſſell that the ſpirits may not vapor away, for there would remaine that which the Goſpell cals <hi>ſal infatuatum,</hi> as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>
               <p>The beſt ſalt then that may be, and the wholeſomeſt, is that which is made with ſea-water in <hi>Bronage.</hi> And after the example thereof, that the trough throughout, where the ſalt water is

Of this little ſalt that I had extracted, I did as I had done with others, ſo that all my ſalt, without loſing any of its ſubſtance, went away in ſweet water, and in this inſenſible ſlime, which came at laſt to one or two ounces.

So <hi>Plinie</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth thereof, in the place alledged, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book and 4 queſtion of his Sympofiacques, without ſalt we can eat nothing agreeable to the taſt, for bread it ſelf is more ſavoury if it be mingled therewith: therefore ordinarily in Churches and covering of tables, they couple <hi>Neptune</hi> with <hi>Ceres,</hi> for ſalt things are as it it were an allurement and a ſpur to excite appetite: So that before any other nouriture wee take that which is ſharp and ſalt, whereas, if they begin with others they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently proſtrate themſelves.

               <p>Salt being there put for one of the greateſt obligations that can be had, becauſe it is a thing pure, neat, holy and ſacred, which men firſt ſet on the table. So that <hi>Aeſchines</hi> in his prayer of the ill adminiſtred Ambaſſie, makes great account of ſalt, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick table, of one City confederate with another. And indeed there is nothing more permanent nor more fixt in the fire, nor more approaching to its nature, becauſe it is mordicant, ſharp, tart, cutting, ſubtill, penetrative, pure and neat, fragrant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combuſtible and incorruptible. Yea, that which preſerves all things from corruption, &amp; by its preparations makes it ſelf clear, cryſtalline, and tranſparent as Air; for glaſſe is nothing elſe then a moſt fixt ſalt that may be extracted from all ſorts of aſhes, and of ſome nearer then of others; but it is not ſo diſſoluble into moiſture as common ſalt; nor that which is extracted out of aſhes by way of lee, which is liquid with it by ſtrong expreſſions of fire, which are notwithſtanding two contrary reſolutions, and reſiſting one the other: chiefly afterward from all liquid humidity, unctuous but inconſumptible. It is moreover the firſt originall as well of mineralls as of ſtones, and pretious ſtones, yea of all other mineralls. Likewiſe of vegetables and of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls, whoſe blood and urinall humour, and all other ſubſtance is ſalted, to preſerve it from putrefaction: and in generall, from all mixed and compoſed Elements; which is herein verified that they reſolve themſelves into it, ſo that it is as the other life of all things; and without it ſaith the Philoſopher <hi>Morien,</hi> nature can no wayes work, nor can any other thing be ingendred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Raimund Lullus</hi> in his teſtament. Whereunto all chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Philoſophers doe adhere; that nothing hath been created here below, in the Elementary part better, nor more pretious then ſalt.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:153427:79"/>
               <p>There is ſalt then, in every thing, and nothing can ſubſiſt but for the ſalt which is therein mixed; which ties the parts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a chain, otherwiſe they would all go into ſmall powder, and give them nouriſhment; for there are two ſubſtances in ſalt, the one viſcous, gluiſh, and unctuous, of the nature of air, which is ſweet; and indeed there is nothing that nouriſheth but what is ſweet; the bitter and the ſalt do not. The other is a duſt, ſharp pricking and biting, of the nature of fire, which is laxative. For all ſalts are laxative, and nothing doth looſe the body, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates not of the nature of ſalt: Mark then, wherefore is it that thoſe that drink ſalt water die ſpeedily of dyſenteries? the ſalt which is mingled therewith cauſing a gnawing in the bowels; for there is nothing corroſive but ſalt, or of the nature of ſalt, fiery of it ſelf, ſaith <hi>Plinie, lib.</hi> 31. <hi>ch.</hi> 9. and yet enemy of actuall fire, for it leaps up and down, it danceth to and fro, and crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, corroding alſo all to which it is faſtened; and drying it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the ſtrongeſt and moſt permanent humidity of all others, and it is a moiſture (ſaith <hi>Geber</hi>) that above all other moiſtures expects an encounter with fire.</p>
               <p>So wee ſee in metals, which are nothing elſe but congealed and baked ſalts, by a long and ſucceſſive decoction, within the earths entralls, where their humidity is abundantly fixt by the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate air it meets withall there. And theſe ſalts do participate of ſulphur and quickſilver, which joined together make a third name Metalline ſalt, which hath the ſame faſhion and reſolution as common ſalt; which is taken for a ſymbole of equity and juſtice; as alſo are metals, but for another conſideration. For melt Gold, Silver, Copper, and other metals together, they wil all mingle equally: So that if upon a hundred parts of ſilver, yea two hundred you melt one of gold, the leaſt part of this ſilver, in what regard ſoever you will take it from the totall maſſe, ſhall in reſpect of it ſelf, take its juſt and equall portion of gold and no more nor leſſe, wherefore they are taken for diſtributive juſtice. But ſalt is for that throughout, where it attacheth fleſh, fiſh, vegetables, it keeps them from corruption, and conſerves them in their entire, and makes them durable for many ages. Fire on the contrary, is an evill hoſt, for it ſtealeth and deſtroyeth all that lodgeth near it, never ceaſing till it hath converted all into aſhes, whence ſalt was extracted, that was before therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153427:79"/> So that theſe two, fire &amp; ſalt, accord and convene together and alſo with the ferments in this, that they convert all that whereupon they can exerciſe their action. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book and 4 queſtion of Sympoſiaques, extolling ſalt, ſets down, that all fleſh and fiſh that was eat is a dead thing, and proceeds from a dead body; but when the faculty of ſalt comes to be introduced, it is a ſoul that revivifies and gives them grace and ſavor. And in the 5 book 10. queſt. renders a reaſon why <hi>Homer</hi> calls ſalt divine; he puts that ſalt is as a temperament and fortification of the viands within the body: and that it gives it an agreement with the appetite. But it is rather for the vertue that it hath to preſerve dead bodies from putrefaction; which is as to reſiſt death, that which appertains to Divinity. <hi>Thou ſhalt (not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi>) not permitting that what is deprived of life ſhould periſh ſo ſuddenly in all kinds: but as the ſoul, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine part within us, keeps the body alive (a ſoul is given to hogs for their ſafety,) this <hi>Plinie</hi> ſets down after the Stoicks. So ſalt alſo takes into its ſafeguard dead fleſh to keep it from putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whence the fire of lightning is reputed for divine; becauſe thoſe that have been touched therewith remain a great while without corruption; as ſalt doth on its part, which hath this property and vertue; which ſheweth the great affinity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they have together. Wherefore <hi>Evenus</hi> was wont to ſay, that fire was the beſt ſauce in the world, and the very ſame is alſo attributed to ſalt. All which things here above do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the occaſion for which <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after him <hi>Pythagoras</hi> made ſo great eſteem of ſalt, to cover under his Allegorie that which they would give to underſtand by it; that our ſouls and conſciences ſignified by man in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> namely, the internall man, and our body for the ſacrifice ought to be offered up unto God, pure and not ſoiled with corruption; <hi>That you offer up your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy pleaſing vnto God, &amp;c.</hi> Therein was there (it may be) another reaſon, that moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to exalt ſalt ſo much, that according as <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth at large in his third book of his <hi>More,</hi> 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ch. where he renders a particular reaſon for the moſt part of Moſaical ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, his principall aim was to overthrow all Idolatries, even rhoſe of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> where they had a greater vogue then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other part. He ſeeing that their Prieſts ſo greatly deteſted ſalt,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153427:80"/> that they would not uſe it in any ſort, for that of the ſea from whence it proceeded; in the bitterneſſe whereof, the ſweet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Nilus</hi> went to loſe and ſalt it ſelf; which they held to be for the radicall moiſture from whence all things here below do ſprout and nouriſh themſelves in deſpite of them, and contrary to their traditions; he would thereof make a form of alliance &amp; paction from God with the Jewiſh people, that all their oblations ſhould be accompanied with ſait: And in the 2 of <hi>Paralip.</hi> 13.5 chap. It is ſaid, that God gave to <hi>David</hi> and his children the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by a Covenant of Salt; that is to ſay, moſt firm and indiſſoluble; for that ſalt hinders corruption. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saviour choſe his Apoſtles to be as the ſalt of men; that is to ſay, to deliver the pure and incorruptible doctrine of the Goſpel; and to confirm them firm perſiſtent faith, as wel by words as deeds. The <hi>Caballiſts</hi> penetrating further into the myſteries incloſed therewithin, meditate certain ſubtilties by a rule of Ghematrie, called <hi>Ghilcal,</hi> which conſiſteth in equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Numbers, which the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> aſſigne unto Letters. Thoſe of this word <hi>Malach</hi> which ſignifieth ſalt, mounts in their ſupputation to 78. for <hi>Mem</hi> valued 40. <hi>Lamed</hi> 30. and <hi>heth</hi> 8. or divided in any ſort that you will, alwaies there will reſult a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number, repreſenting a myſtery of Divine names; the half which makes 39. mount to as much as the letters of <hi>Chuzu;</hi> the ſcabbard or covering of this great Name for <hi>caph. val.</hi> 20. <hi>vau</hi> 6. <hi>Z.</hi> 7. and the other <hi>vau</hi> 6, if in 3 parts, each wil mount to 26. which is the number <hi>tetragrammaton Jehovah, vau</hi> making 10. <hi>he</hi> 5. <hi>vau</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>he</hi> 5. In ſix parts this will be 13. for each, which are equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the number of Piety. In 13. there are 6. which <hi>vau</hi> is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at, a letter repreſenting eternall life; beſides that ſix is the firſt perfect number, becauſe his parts do conſtitute it, his ſixt namely 1. his third 2. and its halfe 3. which perfection hath not any one of the other numbers, and in ſix dayes the ſtructure of the Univerſe was perfected.</p>
               <p>There are other myſteries in the Scripture; in 26. will be the number of the moſt holy &amp; ſacred Trinitie, for three times 26. makes 78.

And finally 87. denotes as many unities, whereof each repreſents the unity of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153427:80"/> the eſſence of one God alone. The ſame is in the <hi>Lechem</hi> bread, which is an anagram of the former, and conſiſteth of the ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It was therefore ſome cauſe of the Proverb, <hi>To eat ſalt with thy bread. Rabbi Solomon</hi> upon the places aforeſaid, of Gods alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his people, deſigned by ſalt, by which is underſtood the Eternall paction of the great Prieſthood of the Meſſiah, brings us a form of an Allegory, very ſtrange and phantaſtick. That the waters here below do mutiny, that they are ſeparated from the ſuperceleſtiall, having the firmament ſet betwixt them; by means whereof, God to appeaſe them, promiſed that they ſhould be perpetually in his ſervice, in all offerings, ſacrifices, as he did afterwards in the Law, which hee gave to the <hi>Jewes; Whatſoever thou ſhalt offer to the Lord, thou ſhalt ſeaſon it with ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet there are divers ſorts of ſalt, that have different proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and vertues, according to the things from which they are extracted; for ſalt retaine a propriety of the thing from whence it came, ſaith <hi>Geber</hi> in his Teſtament, yea as many odors, and ſapors as there are, they all do depend upon ſalt; for where there is no ſalt, there is no ſmell nor taſt; and yet of all the taſts which <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Naturall cauſes doth limit to eight, <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. extends them to 13. there is not one, that is not ſalt, becauſe taſt (as <hi>Plato</hi> will have it) comes from water, which creep athwart the ſtalk of every plant, and keeps the ſaltneſs that it cannot paſſe as it is more groſſe and terreſtriall, as wee ſee in ſea-water when it is diſtilled; where when they paſſe it through ſand, where it leaves its ſaltneſſe. But it may be ſaid to <hi>Plato,</hi> that the taſt doth not only ly in plants, but alſo in Animalls and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, and all other compounded Elements. It is that which he and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other rationall Philoſophers, are only ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with, that which their arguments and diſcourſe do imprint in their phantaſies: eſteeming that it cannot be otherwiſe, then that which their reaſons do demonſtrate unto them, for the moſt part falſe and erroneous; there were if they would penetrate empirickly by the experiments, they might have been ſhewed by the finger of the eye, the truth of the thing, they might have been better aſcertained therein, as the <hi>Arabians</hi> have ſince done; and the Chymicall Philoſophers, who will aſſure themſelves of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what they have oftentimes tried without variation
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:153427:81"/> to the ſenſe.

And on the contrary in a ſtrong expreſſion of fire blowing upon the lead, then which nothing can be darker, it will convert into a forme of a hyacinth ſo tranſparent, that one may read a ſmall letter through it: though it were an inch thick, and this hyacinth by the ſame fire returne into lead, and lead into an hyacinth.</p>
               <p>If then theſe profound Contemplators of nature, and her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, had been willing to accompany their Imaginary diſcourſes, with experience that reveales infinite ſecrets by fire, they could never have fallen into ſuch abſurdities: and had manifeſtly ſeen without any vail or obſtacle all full of things whereof they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in irreſolution and doubt not having ſpoken therein but as blind men and by gueſſe, for we cannot diſcover the ſecrets of things to proceed therein directly, nor come to it by entring on it, after manner of ſpeech, by the foregate: for nature goeth in her workes rarely and in ſecret, as by the poſterne gate: or by ſetting ladders againſt the windowes: The <hi>Greeks</hi> call that <gap reason="foreign">

But ſimple water of it ſelfe alone would not be ſufficient to nouriſh, if it were not aſſiſted with things faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the earth, the ſalt therein incloſed and therewith mingled, having a ſweet and glutinous unctuoſity, for as in the Sea-water there are two ſubſtances, ſweet and ſalt, there are ſubalternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two in ſalt: But we cannot ſay that they doe nouriſh or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing. Therefore is it, that they uſe to raze Traiters-houſes, and ſow them with ſalt as reputed unworthy to produce any more. Salt indeed produceth nothing as it is, where its ſweet ſubſtance is ſo drowned with the ſalt, that it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſelfe in action, ſo as it is, except it be freed out of priſon, for the ſaltneſſe predominates over it, and covers it. But for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereunto which was ſaid before, that freſh water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, doth neither nouriſh nor produce any thing: which we ſee to the contrary, by experience in many wateriſh herbs that grow in the midſt of waters, and in flints that it engenders ſhells, and fiſhes, and wormes: to be ſhort, that its procreation doth extend to the three compoſed kinds of Minerals, Vegetables, &amp; Animals: And indeed put little pebbles in a phial, and water thereon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, renewing it daily, at the end of certaine time, you will find them ſo great, and ſo bigge, that they cannot come out at the neck by which they were put in. But indeed all this proceeds from the ſlime, which is mingled with the water, as frogs, and other things, which are procreated in the middle Region of the aire of the ſlime which the Sun beams hath thence raiſed with the water, for al rains, ſnowes, and other ſuch impreſſions partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate much of the ſlime; from thence it comes that the ſnow doth ſmoak and fatten the earth, and the water of raine, is more connaturall to trees, herbes, and ſeeds, chiefly thoſe which fall by ſtormes and thunders, then thoſe of wels and rivers: whereof <hi>Plutarch</hi> forceth himſelfe to bring forth many reaſons in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, which have no great apparence: There is yet more to ſay, for that they are better baked and accompanied with more ſubtle and hot ſlime, and are of lighter concoction and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then plants; as of meate in the ſtomach of <hi>Animals,</hi> ſome more then others, where the waters here below are more raw and indigeſted: we inſiſt a little in water, becauſe ſalt is nothing elſe, but water mingled and ſetled with dry and burned earth, of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:153427:82"/> the nature of fire which makes it bitter and ſalt. So that before we paſſe from this ſubject of freſh water, we will here touch upon an experiment of more rare things from whence come many fair &amp; ſcret conſiderations. Sweet water is a body ſo homogeneal, that it would ſeem to the ſight ſo cleare, tranſparent, and liquid, in all its parts, reſembling to it ſelfe, that there is in it but one only ſubſtance: ſince that by d ſtillations ſhee paſſeth all. But yet there is another found ſubſtance, ſolid, and compact, in the forme of earth, mingled with its liquid homogeneity, which it ſeparates by Artifice, and it is that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in the ſwarme of Philoſophers. The earth is concreat by the groſſeneſſe of the water. And this may be ſeene with water agitated and beaten and after rediſtilled many times, alwayes ſeparating the fift or ſixth part which ſhall paſſe the firſt. You muſt then take a good quantity of wel water, or the ſame of fountaine, river or rain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let it ſettle twenty or thirty houres untill there be ſome ordure or ſlime, it ſeparates it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Take of this water as you may ſay forty pintes, and cauſe the halfe to vapour away by very eaſie fire, that it boile not, put theſe twenty pintes apart, and take new water as above, of which you ſhall evaporate the moity; and ſo long continue it, that you may have well a hundred pintes halfe evaporated; from this one hundred, make to evaporate thirty pintes, and of ſixty, ten, twenty, of fifty, that ſhall remain twenty of thirty, ten, and of twenty, ten; and caſt away all theſe ſlimes that ſhall reſide, for they are nothing worth, and are but immundicity and ordure, unto the ſeaventh or eighth evaporation or diſtillation, after which there will appeare in your water infinite little atomes and little bodies; which at laſt by little and little will be congealed into one ſolid ſubſtance, of a griſly colour, ſoft as dough: <hi>Of which I have ſeen ſuch admirable effects that men would hardly beleeve it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abundance of fluxes of blood.</note> 
                  <hi>in Cankers, Gangrenes, Hemorrhagies, bloody flux, Women newly laid in bed; and at noſe, diſeaſes in the ſtomach, and infinite other ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that no</hi> terra ſigillata <hi>nor</hi> Bolarmoniac <hi>could compare with.</hi> You may make your round pills impaſting them with the laſt waters that were extracted, which are alſo of great vertue, <hi>to waſh wounds, inveterate Maladies of the ſtomach, and other the like; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt keepe them well.</hi> You may alſo calcine it for ſix or ſeven houres in a ſmall pot well luted, and caſting thereon vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153427:82"/> diſtilled, boiling, diſſolving one part, nouriſhing the reſt; calcine it againe, and diſſolve it till you have all the ſalt which will be white and of ſweet taſt, make it diſſolve to oile, you may draw from thence great effects even upon Gold. But ſea-water is yet of more efficacy then that of wels and rivers, ſweet water (I ſay) which ſhall be ſeparated from ſalt by diſtillation: which would be eaſie to do near the Sea, having to that end foure or five alembies of leaden earth, and yet more of ſweet water which is drawne by diſtillation of ſalt reſolved in liquor to humidity.</p>
               <p>But there is yet another manner of proceeding, in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubſtances of common water: and more ſpirituall then the precedent. Take very clean water: out of a well, river or fountain, let it ſettle twenty foure houres, and take the pure and the cleare, which you ſhall put in veſſels of <hi>Beauvois</hi> earth: well ſtopped to putrifie in hot dung fourty dayes, renewing it two or three times every week, filter the water, and give only five or ſix boylings, ſcumming off the ſcurfes that ariſe thereon with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then put it in <hi>Cornues</hi> of glaſſe, not putting therein but the third part, or the moity at moſt, of that which they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and diſtill of two parts three; then change the Recipient, and accompliſh to diſtill all the water, but with an eaſie fire. Then ſtrengthen the fire, by little and little, till you ſee ſmall fumes aſcend, continue this degree of fire, with increaſing untill it mount no more. Let the fire quench of it ſelfe and recoole the veſſell: then gather the ſalt which ſhall be ſo elevated towards the beck of the <hi>Cornue,</hi> and within the recipient, and keep it in a veſſel of earth, very cloſe and ſealed in a warm and dry place that it melt not, nor diſſolve. Put the <hi>Cornue</hi> to againe with that which remains in the bottome, and ſtrengthen the fire untill you ſee a reddiſh oile; end your diſtillation, after ceaſe the fire. Take the black feces, that remain in the bottome, ſtampe them, and put them in a ſublimatory of good earth, of an inch thick, and no more, for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x houres, firſt a little fire, then reinforce it for twelve others, till the ſublimatory be red, the fire being alwaies in the ſame degree: let it coole and gather the ſalt which will be moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and keep it as the former. This is the ſecond <hi>ſal Armoniac volatill,</hi> which is extracted from the water: and the one, and the other, have great power to the diſſolution of gold, carrying no danger with then as your common <hi>ſal Armoniac</hi> may doe; which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153427:83"/> hath bad qualities in it, there, where this is extracted from a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſo familiar to mans body, which is ſweet water. Now take all the feces &amp; reſidences, which remain in the bottome of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, bruiſe them, and make them diſſolve in the firſt water, which you ſhall have diſtilled, after you have warmed it a little; that it may diſſolve the ſalt that may be there. Let them repoſe, then eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate, and put them to diſtill with halfe the water: Then change the Recipient, and with a little ſtronger fire, diſtill the Surpluſage of the water, and keep them each a part, in a cold place. But doe not perfect to congeal all the ſalt in the bottome of the veſſell, but leave therein a little moiſture, to create flakes of ice. If it be not white enough, let it calcine for three or foure houres in a pot of earth not leaded, after diſſolve it in the ſecond water, filter and congeale it, and keep it in a dry place, for this is ſalt fix and fuſible. If in drawing the firſt <hi>Salarmoniac, volatill,</hi> the foule oile that is nothing worth mounts with it, you muſt put ſalt and oile in new water, and depure and putrifie it as before, which was to begin againe, therefore we muſt goe wiſely to worke. There is another manner of proceeding therein, which is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for there are more wayes to one intent, and to one end, ſaith <hi>Geber.</hi> Take raine or fountain water, put it in a <hi>Cornue,</hi> upon the ſand with a ſlow fire: and diſtill thereof a fourth part, which is more rare and ſubtill. Continue afterwards the diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even to the feces, which you caſt away. And ſee that you have good ſtore of this meane ſubſtance, with which, you ſhall reiterate the diſtillation ſeaven times, being alwayes the fourth part that will firſt iſſue out, which is the phlegme, and the feces are the ſlime. In the fourth, you ſhall begin to ſee the ſulphuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all colours in the forme of <hi>huskes and pieces of gold.</hi> The ſeaven diſtillations being perfected put your meane ſubſtance in an alembec, to the fire with a ſoft bath: and draw that which may aſcend, which ſhall be yet of phlegme, then you ſhall ſee created little ſtones, and pieces of all colours which will goe to the bottome: ſtay your diſtillation, and let them ſettle, then eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate that which remains ſweetly with water: and doe ſo, with all your mean ſubſtance, and make there little ſtones to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the bath. When you ſhall have enough dry them in the Sun, or before an eaſie fire, and put them in a glaſſe-bottle well ſealed, with the fire of a lampe or the like, for three or foure
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153427:83"/> months, and your matter will be congealed and fixed except a certaine ſmall portion thereof, which will ariſe along the ſides of the veſſell: This here is the mean ſubſtance, of the firſt matter of all things, which is water. But that we be not deceived or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all theſe practiſes, which are but an image and portrait halfe rudely hewen out of the manner which we muſt hold in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of liquors. From whence they reſolve of themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moiſture, all ſorts of ſalt, as well common, as <hi>Salalkali, tartar,</hi> and other the like; the ſweet oleaginous ſubſtance ſwimming above the water with the ſalt and bitter, which there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſſolved, and after the extraction of the water, remaineth a congealed ſalt in the bottome; that is to ſay, to ſeparate the oile from ſalts: which cannot be done without great artifice: But it is not reaſonable to diſcover it, and divulge all openly; but to reſerve ſomething therein, for far of doing wrong to the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours of ſome learned men who have taken ſo much paines and travail, to come to the knowledge of theſe fine ſecrets.</p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed me in ſome ſort to runne through the foreſaid experiments of water as well for the importance and rarity which they have, as for that it depends upon ſalt whereof water makes the principall part: and likewiſe of the ſea, from whence ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſweet ſubſtance the ſalt remains ſolid congealed; and of this ſalt reſolved by it ſelfe, to moiſture, they extract by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the greateſt part of ſweet water; by meanes whereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departure from this ſubject of ſalt, it will not be amiſſe, to touch here ſomething of the Sea, whoſe water is as a body, the ſalt encloſed not perceiveable to the ſight, but well to the taſt, are the vitall ſpirits, and the oleaginous inflamable ſubſtance enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped within the ſalt; the ſoule, and the life of the nature of aire, or of wind; remember becauſe wind is my life. There are then two ſubſtances in the Sea, and by conſequent in ſalt; the one liquid, and volatile, which aſcends upward, and is double, water namely and oile; the one and the other ſweet and freſh: And the other fix, and ſolid, which is bitter and ſalt; wherefore it was that <hi>Homer</hi> called the <hi>Ocean</hi> the father of Gods and of men, for by ſtretching out of all ſide croſſewiſe, the Conduits and ſpongioſities of the earth which hee holds encompaſſed round about: as a dry hanging on to ſome rock there within
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153427:84"/> by a providence of nature is made a ſeparation of ſubſtances of the freſh, namely, and of the ſalt: for the Marine water, paſſeth through theſe Conduits, they unſalt it, even as they ſhould diſtill it by an <hi>Alembic</hi> of <hi>Cornue,</hi> or as one ſhould paſſe it through ſand many times, part whereof ſhould remaine baked in the earth for the production and nouriture of vegetables part paſſeth through ſprings, wells, and fountaines, whence all flouds and rivers are formed, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>All rivers runne into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full, unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> And part elevates it ſelfe aloft, by meanes of the Sun and ſtarres, which draw and ſuck them, as well for their nouriture, as for the formation of raines, ſnowes, hailes, and other aqueous expreſſions in the aire. The ſalt which is more groſſe, heavy and terreſtriall remains inviſqued in the veines, and conduits of the earth, where heat incloſed bakes it, digeſts, alters, and changes it into another nature for the production of all ſorts of Minerals, by meanes of the portion of freſh water mingled therewith, which diſſolves and waſheth off theſe ſalts, ſo that finally, having been brought to their laſt perfection according to natures intention, ſhee enformes that which ſhee hath determined. The Sea then is not ſo barren and unfruitfull as ſome poets and Philoſophers have made it; <hi>Plato</hi> himſelfe, in his <hi>Phaedon,</hi> where he ſaith, that nothing could be there procreated worthy of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> becauſe all the Animals procreated therein are wild, untameable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docill, and in which there is neither amity nor ſweetneſſe. But what ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> that ſaved <hi>Arion,</hi> and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, alledged by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treaty: What animalls are the wiſeſt, thoſe on land, or thoſe in the water? of fiſhes likewiſe wherewith the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſerved, as with a chained Grayhound? But it is very ſmal, to take fiſh, never letting go what he hath once faſtned on. Truely a Brach nor couching ſpaniell, cannot bee more ſpirituall, or docible then this fiſh, at leaſt if it be true what is related to have often times been ſeen by the eye, in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth booke of <hi>Gonzalo d'Ovidiedo</hi> of his naturall hiſtory of the <hi>Indies. Chap</hi> 10. <hi>And of Peter Martyr, of another ſort of fiſh called Manati, which being taken at Sea very little, and from thence put into a ſtanding lake, became tame, and privately would come, and take bread from mens hands: and would not faile to come a good way off, when hee was called, leaving himſelfe to be handled at their pleaſure, and carried
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:153427:84"/> them upon his back, as on a bridge croſſe the lake, from one ſide to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> But freſh water fiſhes, are they more docile then thoſe of the Sea? The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Preiſts, above all others abhorred the Sea, calling it the finall end, the death, and deſtruction of all things: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the water thereof, killeth all Animalls that drink thereof: and is as the ſepulcher of all rivers, that goe loſe themſelves and die therein; and the earth is the ſame for all bodies, from whence none are ſpewed out. <q>To this purpoſe <hi>Chiia</hi> in the <hi>Zohar</hi> deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the death of <hi>Rabbi Simeon</hi> author thereof, after he had caſt himſelfe on the earth and embraced him, uſed ſuch a language, <hi>O earth, earth, duſt, duſt,</hi> how hard and unpitifull art thou? For whatſoever is moſt deſireable to the ſight, thou makeſt old and deformed, thou breakeſt in peices the ſhining Columnes of the world. How doeſt thou quench the cleare reſplendent lights which received theirs from the eternall living ſpring, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the whole world was illuſtrated! The Princes and Potentates given to the people to governe them, and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Juſtice unto them, by which they are maintained, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, waxe old and end in thee: and thou remaineſt alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in thy ſelfe, not being able to ſatisfie or ſatiate thy ſelfe with ſo many bodyes, that returne thither: ſo that the world is therein confounded and loſt, and afterwards renewes it ſelf of a ſuddaine.</q> But for the regard of the Sea, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts had it in ſuch deteſtation, that they could not endure to ſee the very Mariners, nor the Iſlanders as people which on all parts were cut off from humane commerce. And the <hi>Britains,</hi> (ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the world by an element which they ſay is the fifth,) ſo auſtere, outrageous, and unpittiable: and for that cauſe they abſtained from ſalt, becauſe that among other things it provoked to laſciviouſneſſe. The occaſion alſo for which they ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Sea, was ſomething myſticall and allegoricall: becauſe it doth not waſh ſpots or uncleanneſſe. So that <hi>Homer</hi> made, and not without reaſon, that <hi>Nauſicaa Alcinous</hi> daughter, waſhed her linnen and clothes in a fountaine of freſh water on the Sea ſhore, for the truth is that Sea-water doth not waſh. That which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> puts it) in the firſt of the <hi>Sympoſiaques</hi> 9. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, referre to the pickle wherewith the Sea-water is alwayes filled, ſo that there being nothing empty therein it could receive no filthineſſe. And lee, is it not the ſame; yea more full of ſalt;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153427:85"/> yea more unctuous and fat then that of the ſea? ſo that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> teſtimony, men put ſea-water in their lamps, to make them ſhine clearer, and caſt upon the flame, it becomes lighted; in which there may be alſo myſtery contained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning fire and ſalt, and their affinity together.</p>
               <p>Join hereunto that wee may ſee that ſalt is an enemy to all filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe; and will not thereto adjoin or aſſociate; no more then fire, which will nothing but pure things, ſaid good <hi>Raimund Lullius.</hi> Yet to the aforeſaid purpoſe, <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his naturall cauſes, ſets down that the ſea-water, doth neither nouriſh nor feed, trees, or plants: becauſe being groſſe and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy it cannot mount into their ſtalks, which thickneſſe and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſeen, for that carryeth greater burthens then the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and this comes from the ſalt therein diſſolved, and it is earthly and conſequently more uneaſy to ſinke. Moreover trees being (according to the opinion of <hi>Plato, Democritus, Anaxagoras,</hi> and others,) a terreſtriall Animall, it cannot give it nouriſhment; for bitter doth not nouriſh, but ſweet only. But what ſhall wee ſay of ſo many fiſhes that are procreated and nouriſhed in the ſea, of herbs alſo, and of trees? <hi>Franciſco de Oviedo lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. ſets down that in the firſt diſcoverie of <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> they found as of great green and yellow medowes in the main ſea, more then two hundred leagues from land, of certain herbes called <hi>Salgazzi,</hi> which go floting on the top of the waters, as the winds carry them from one ſide to another. In the relation of <hi>Francis Vlloa,</hi> he ſets down that the root of the herbs, whereof he gives the deſcription and figure, do not ſink more then 12 or 15 fadome in the water, yellow yet, as wax.</p>
               <p>But wee ſufficiently ſee trees and buſhes growing along the ſea-ſhore, and even in the very ſea: yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> inſiſteth that thoſe that grow along the ſhore of the Red-ſea, are there procreated &amp; nouriſhed with the ſlime which the flouds carry thither, and fall therein; which he might have ſpoken more properly of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſea, otherwiſe called <hi>Pontus Euxinus.</hi> And <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cha.</hi> 22. that the herbs which grow within the water are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with rains: but it would follow, that if ſo, they ſhould procreate in all other places where it rains indifferently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with better reaſon refers it to the groſſe and unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaltneſſe which is therewith mingled. Salt being fat and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153427:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> unctuous, which is the cauſe that ſalt water doth not ſo eaſily quench fire, as freſh water. But this ſaltneſſe is equall throughout all the ſea. <hi>Plinie</hi> himſelf <hi>lib.</hi> 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 11. ſpecifies, Certain herbes which ſalt waters do much profit. Theſe are ſecrets of Nature to which mans diſcourſe can hardly arrive. For herbs by a providence thereof may well ſuck and draw from ſalt water, a freſh or ſweet ſubſtance wherewith they are procreated and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as the fiſhes.</p>
               <p>But this is not our principall drift: we have here endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhew that Salt is not unfruitfull, but the cauſe of fertility provoking venereall appetite, whence <hi>Venus</hi> is ſaid to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the ſea; if men give ſalt unto animalls to heat them the more, and make them eat ſalt as <hi>Plutarch</hi> puts it in his 3. queſton of Naturall cauſes. And wee ſee by experience, that in ſhips laden with ſalt, rats and mice, are ſooner engendred then in others; this which muſt ſo much the more cry down ſalt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of holy things, from whence all mutability and lubricity muſt be banniſhed; but ſalt is in the number of things that are applyed to the good, and to the bad part. Of the good we have heretofore alledged many places. Of the bad for the ſterility, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.5. All ſhall aſſemble themſelves in the wild valley which is now the ſea of ſalt. And in the 19. chap. 26. as alſo in the 10. of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> v. 7. of <hi>Lots</hi> wife, who for her incredulity and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the Angels voice, ſhe was turned into a pillar of ſalt: And <hi>Judges</hi> 9.45. the habitations of Rebells and Traitors were razed and ſowed with ſalt. And in the 2 of <hi>Zephaniah</hi> v. 9. <hi>Moab</hi> ſhall be as <hi>Sodome,</hi> a deſolation of nettles, and thiſtles and heaps of ſalt.</p>
               <p>But we ſee upon the ebbing and flowing of the ſalt pits in the Marſhes of <hi>Zai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

There is yet another reaſon, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> alledgeth, That
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153427:86"/> throughout where there is Salt nothing can grow thick, or be cloſe together: which conſtipation would hinder herbs to thruſt out: Moreover many medicaments and remedies do come from ſalt: whereupon I will not here loſe time, on that which <hi>Plinie, Dioſcorides,</hi> and others, have ſet down and treated of curſorily and in haſt, with cloſed eyes one after another, not having made proof thereof; add to this, it is ſo triviall and beaten as nothing more, but will touch here, in paſſing the Countrey, an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof I have ſeen very admirable effects in burning feavers and unquietneſſe, where they could not take reſt. It is a frontall made in this manner.</p>
               <p>Take the yolk of a freſh Eg, and as much groſſe ſalt, beat them together in ſhape of an ointment, which you ſhall apply to your forehead, between two folded linnen clothes: It doth not coole the brain, nor cauſe ſuch accidents; as conſerve of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do, <hi>Oxyrhodinon</hi> likewiſe, and brings much more comfort.</p>
